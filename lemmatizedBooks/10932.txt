the earth 's crust when it cool after the last convulsive movement of genesis in all the region about the galerium pass the silence of the dry arizona air seem luminous and eternal whoever climb to the crotch of that v cut jag against the sky for distance yet unreckoned by tourist folder might have the reward of pitch the tent of he imagination at the gateway of the cloud early on a certain afternoon he would have note to the eastward a speck far out on a vast basin of sand which be enclose by a rim of tumble mountain continue observation at long range would have show the speck to be move almost imperceptibly with what seem the impertinence of infinitesimal life in that dead world and eventually it would have take the form of a man astride a pony the man be young fantastically young if you be to judge by he garb a flamboyant expression of the romantic cowboy style which might have serve as a sensational exhibit in a shop-window in place of the conventional blue wool shirt be one of dark blue silk the _ chaparejo _ or chap be of the softest leather with the fringe at the seam generously long and the silver spur at the boot-heel be chase in antique pattern and ridiculously large instead of the conventional handkerchief at the neck be a dark red string tie while the straight-brimmed cowpuncher hat out of keep with the general effect of newness and launder freshness have that tint which only exposure to many dewfall and many blaze mid-day will produce in light-colored feel there be vagrancy in the smile of he singularly sensitive mouth and vagrancy in the relax way that he ride from the fondness with which he gaze sweep the naked peak they might have be city _ en fête _ call he to they festivity if so he be in no haste to let realization overtake anticipation he rein hang loose he hum snatch of spanish french and english song they cosmopolitan freedom of variety be as out of keep with the scene as they lilt which have the tripping self-carrying impetus of the sheer joy of live lapse into silence he face go ruminative and then sad with a sudden indrawing of breath he free himself from he reverie and bend over from he saddle pat a buckskin neck in affectionate tattoo tawny ear turn backward in appreciative fellowship but without any break in a plod dog-trot though the rider 's aspect might say with the desert that time be nothing the pony 's express a logical purpose thus the speed of they machine-like progress be entirely regulate by the prospect of a measure of oats at the journey 's end when they come to the foot-hill and the rider dismount and lead the way with a follow muzzle at time poke the small of he back up the tortuous path round pinnacle and skim the edge of abyss he leg muscle answer with the readiness of familiarity with climb at the top he see why the pass have receive its name of galerium from the spanish a great isosceles of precipitous wall form a long natural gallery which the heaving of the earth 's crust have rent and time have erode it lay near the present boundary line of two civilization : in the neutral zone of desert expanse where the saxon pioneer with he lip close on english _ s 's _ have pause in he progress southward and the _ conquistadore _ with tongue caress castilian vowel have pause in he progress northward at the other side the traveller behold a basin which be a thousand foot higher than the one behind he it approach the pass at a gentler slope it must be cooler than the other its ozone a little rarer a sea of quiver and sing light in the afternoon glow it be lose in the horizon not far from the foot-hill float a patch of foliage checker by the roof of the house of a irrigation colony hanging kitelike at the end of the silver thread of a river whose water have set garden abloom in sterile expanse there seem a refusal of intimacy with the one visible symbol of its relation with the outer world for the railroad with its line of steel flash across the gray level pass beyond the outer edge of the oasis this beat any valley i have see yet and the traveller speak with the confidence of one who be a connoisseur of arizona valley he pause for some time in hesitancy to take a farewell of the rapturous vista a hundred foot lower and the refraction of the light would present it in different coloring and perspective with he spell of visual intoxication run the consciousness of be utterly alone but the egoism of he isolation in the tower infinite do not endure for the sound of voice a man 's and a woman 's break on he ear the man 's be strident disagreeable persistent its timbre be such as he have hear come out of the door of border saloon the woman 's be quiet and resist its quality of youth peculiarly emphasize by its restrained emotion now the easy traveller take stock of he immediate surroundings which have interested he only as a foothold and vantage-point for the panorama that he have be breathe in here of all conceivable place he be in danger of become eavesdropper to a conversation which be evidently very personal round the escarpment at he elbow he see on a shelf of decay granite two wait pony one have a mexican saddle of the cowboy type the other have a eastern side-saddle which strike he as exotic in a land where woman mostly ride astride and what woman whatever style of ride she choose should care to come to this pass judge by the direction from which the voice come the speaker be hide by still another turn in the defile a few more step bring eye as well as ear back to the living world with the sight of a girl seat on a bowlder he could see nothing of she face except the cheek which be brown and the tip of a chin which he guess be oval and she hair which be dark under she hatbrim and shimmering with gold where it be kiss by the ray of the sun a impression as swift as a flash of light could not exclude inevitable curiosity as to the full face a curiosity emphasize by the poise erectness of she slender figure the man be bend over she in a familiar way he be thirty perhaps in the prime of physical vigor square-jawed cocksure a six-shooter sling at he hip though she be not give way before he she attitude in its steadiness reflect distress in a bowstrung tremulousness suddenly at something he say which the easy traveller could not quite understand she spring up aflame she hand fly back against the rock wall behind she for support then the man speak so loud that he be distinctly audible when you get mad like that you be prettier 'n ever he say it be a peculiar situation it seem incredible melodramatic unreal in sight of the crawl freight train far out on the level be not you overplay you part sir the easy traveller ask the man 's hand fly to he six-shooter while the girl look around in swift and eager impulse to the interrupt voice its owner the color scheme of he attire emphasize by the glare of the low sun express in he pose and the inquire flicker of a smile purely the element of the casual far from make any movement toward he own six-shooter he seem oblivious of any such necessity with the first glimpse of she face when he see the violet flame of she anger go ruddy with surprise and relief then fluid and sparkling as a culminate change of emotion he feel cheap for have ask himself the question -- which now seem so superficial -- whether she be good-looking or not she be undoubtedly yes undoubtedly good-looking in a way of she own what business be it of yours demand the man evidently under the impression that he be due to say something while he finger still rest on he holster none at all unless she say so the deliverer answer be it he ask she after she first glance at he she have lower she lash now she raise they send a direct message beside which she first glance have be dumb indifference he be see into the depths of she eye in the consciousness of a privilege rarely bestow they give wing to a thousand inquiry he have the thrill of a explorer who be about to enter on a voyage of discovery then the veil be draw before he ship have even put out from port it be a veil weave with fine thread of appreciative and conventional gratitude it be she say decisively i 'll be go say the persecutor with a grimace that seem mixed partly of inherent bravado and partly of shame as he pulse slow down to normal as you please answer that easy traveller i have no mind to exert any positive direction over you movement he politeness he disinterestedness and he evident disinclination to any kind of vehemence carry a implication more exasperating than a open challenge they change melodrama into comedy they make he protagonist appear a negligible quantity there be some thing i do not do when woman be around the persecutor return grudgingly and go for he horse while oppressive silence prevail the easy traveller be not look at the girl or she at he he be regard the other man idly curiously though not contemptuously as he mount and start down the trail toward the valley only to draw rein as he look back over he shoulder with a glare which take the easy traveller in from head to foot huh you near-silk dude he say chokingly in he rancor which have grow with the few minute he have have for self-communion if you mean my shirt it be sell to I for pure silk the easy traveller return in half-diffident correction of the statement we 'll meet again come the more definite and articulate defiance perhaps who can tell arizona though a large place have so few people that it be humanly very small now the other man rise in he stirrup rest the weight of he body on the palm of the hand which be on the back of he saddle he be rigid he voice be shake with very genuine though dramatic rage draw to a fine point of determination when we do meet you better draw i give you warn he call there be no sign that this threat have make the easy traveller tighten a single muscle but a trace of scepticism have creep into he smile whew he draw the exclamation out into a whistle whistle -- whistle while you can you will not have many more chance draw you tenderfoot but it will not do any good -- i 'll get you with this challenge the other settle back into the saddle and proceed on he way whew the second whistle be anything but truculent and anything but apologetic it have the unconscious and spontaneous quality of the delight of the collector who find a new specimen in wild place from under she lash the girl have be watch the easy traveller rather than she persecutor first studiously then in the confusion of embarrassment that leave she speechless well well he conclude you must take not only you zoology but you anthropology as you find it he drollness he dry contemplation of the specimen and he absurdly gay and unpractical attire form a combination of element suddenly group into a effect that touch she reflex nerve after the strain with the magic of humor she could not help herself : she burst out laugh at this he look away from the specimen look around puzzle quizzically and in sympathetic impulse begin laugh himself thus a wholly unmodern incident take a whimsical turn out of a horror which if farcical in the abstract be no less potent in the concrete quite like the middle age be not it he say but walter scott cease write in the thirty she return quick to fall in with he cue the swoon age outlast he -- last indeed into the era of hoop-skirt but that too be go they do give medal she add for rescue the drown only and they be a great nuisance to carry around in one 's baggage please do not recommend I both laugh again softly look fairly at each other in understand twentieth-century fashion she be not to play the classic damsel or he the classic rescuer yet the fact of a young man find a young woman brutally annoy on the roof of the world five or six mile from a settlement -- well it be a fact over the bump of they self-introduction free of the serious impression of she experience she could think for he as well as for herself this strike she with sudden alarm i fear i have make you a dangerous enemy she say pete leddy be the prize ruffian of we community of little river i think that this would be a interesting valley he return in bland appreciation of she contribution of information about the habit of the specimen ii dinosaur or desperado she face a situation irritating and vitalize and inevitably under its grow perplexity she observation of he appearance and characteristic have be acute with feminine intuition which be so frequently right that we forget that it may not always be she imagine he with a certain amiable aimlessness turn he pony to one side so as not to knock down a danger sign while he ride straight over a precipice what would have happen if leddy have really draw she ask herself probably she deliverer would have regard the muzzle of leddy 's gun in studious vacancy before a bullet send he to kingdom come all speculation aside she problem be how to rescue she rescuer she feel almost motherly on he account he be so blissfully oblivious to reality and she feel too that under the circumstance she ought to be formal now mister -- she begin and the mister sound odd and stilted in she ear in relation to he jack be my name he say simply mine be mary she volunteer give he as much as he have give and no more now sir she go on in peremptory earnestness this be serious it _ be _ he answer at least unpleasant it be _ now _ pete leddy mean what he say when he say that he would draw he ought to from he repeated emphasis answer jack in agreeable affirmation he have six notch on he gun-handle -- six man that he have kill mary go on whew say jack and he be not more than thirty he seem a hard worker who keep right on the job she press she lip together to control she amusement before she ask categorically with the precision of a school-mistress : do you know how to shoot he be surprise he seem to be wonder if she be not make sport of he why should i carry a six-shooter if i do not he ask this convinced she that he revolver be a part of he play cowboy costume he have come out of the east thinking that desperado etiquette of the bad land be _ opéra bouffe _ leddy be a dead shot he will give you no chance she insist i should think not jack muse no naturally not otherwise there might have be no sixth notch the third or the fourth even the second object of he favor might have blast he fair young career as a wood-carver have he set any limit to he ambition be he go to make it a even hundred and then retire i do not know she gasp i must ask he add thoughtfully be he out of he head certainly he eye be not insane its bluish-gray be twinkling enjoyably into hers you exasperate he with that whistle it be a deadly insult to he desperado pride you be marked -- do not you see marked she persist and i bring it on i be responsible he shake he head in a denial so unmoved by she appeal that she be sure he would send job into a apoplectic frenzy pardon I but you be contradict you own statement you just say it be the whistle he correct she it be the whistle that give I check number seven you have not the least bit of responsibility the whistle get it all just as you say this be too much confute she with she own word quibble with he own danger in order to make she a accomplice of murder she lose she temper completely that fact alone could account for the audacity of she next remark i wonder if you really know enough to come in out of the rain she storm that be the blessing of living in arizona he return it be such a dry climate she catch herself laugh and this only make she the more intense a second later on a different tack now she would plead please -- please promise I that you will not go to little river to-night promise that you will turn back over the pass you put I between the devil and the dragon what you ask be impossible i 'll tell you why he go on confidentially you know this be the land of fossil dinosaur i have a brute on my hand she think now i have the mad hatter and the march hare in collaboration there be a big dinosaur come to life on the other side he proceed i just get through the pass in time i could feel he breath on my back -- a hot gun-powdery breath it be awful simply awful and horrible too and just as i have resign myself to be he entrée by great luck he big middle get wedge in the bottom of the v and he scale scrape like the plate of a ship against a stone pier to she disgust she be laugh again if i go back now out of fear of pete leddy he continue that dinosaur would know that i be such insignificant prey he would not even take the trouble to knock I down with a forepaw he would swallow I alive and run think of that slimy slide down the red upholstery of he gullet not to mention the misery of a total loss of my dignity and self-respect he have speak it all as if he believe it true he make it seem almost true i like nonsense as much as anybody she begin and i do not forget that you do I a great kindness which any stranger any third person come at the right moment might have do he interrupt sir walter 's age have pass yes but pete leddy belong still farther back we may laugh at he ruffianly bravado but no one may laugh at a forty-four calibre bullet think what you be go to make I pay for you kindness i must pay with memory of the sound of a shot and the fall of a body there in the street of little river -- a nightmare for life oh i beg of you though it be fun for you to be kill consider I do not go down into that valley i beg of you go back over the pass there be no act no suspicion of a gesture she stand quite still while all the power of she eye reflect the misery which she picture for herself the low pitch of she voice sound its depths with that restraint which make for the most poignant intensity as she reach she climax he have come out of he languid pose he be erect and rigid she see he as some person other than the one to whom she have begin she appeal he be still smile but he smile be of a different sort instead of be the significant thing about he in expression of he casualness it seem the soften compensation for he stubbornness i would like to but it be hardly in human nature for I to do that i can not and he ask if he might bring up she pony yes she consent she think that the faint bow of courtesy with which he have accompany the announcement of he decision he would have give in common politeness to anyone who point at the danger sign before he ride over the precipice may i ride down with you or shall i go ahead he inquire after he have assist she to mount with I she answer quickly you be safe while you be with I the decisive turn to she mobile lip and the faint wrinkle of a frown come and go in various heraldry form a vividly sentient and versatile expression of emotion while she watch he silhouette against the sky as he turn to get he own pony come pd -- come along he call in answer to he voice a equine face peculiarly reflective of trail wisdom bony and large particularly over the eye slowly turn toward its master pd be consider come along the trail pd and pd come but with democratic independence take he time to get into motion he be never fast jack explain but once he have the motor go he keep at it all day so i call he pd without the q as he be never quick pretty damn you mean she exclaim with a certain spontaneous pride of understand then she flush in confusion oh thank you it be so human of you to translate it out loud it be not profane look at he now do not you think it be a good name for he jack ask seriously i do she be laugh again oblivious of the impending tragedy iii jack ride in company let not the grundy woman raise a eyebrow of deprecation at the informal introduction of jack and mary or we shall refute she with she own precept which make the step to a throne the step of the social pyramid if she wish a sponsor we name a impeccable majesty of the very oldest dynasty of all which be entirely without scandal we remind she of the ancient rule that people who meet at court vouch for by royal favor need no introduction these two have meet under the roof of the eternal painter he palette be somewhere in the upper ether and he head in the interplanetary space he heavy eyebrow twinkle with star-dust dodge occasional fly meteor which harass he as fly harass a landscapist out of door on a hot day he be ever active this mighty artist of the change desert sky so fickle he mood so versatile he genius so quick to creation he fancy that he never know what he next composition will be till the second that it be begin no earthly rival need be jealous of he he will never clog the gallery he always paint on the same canvas scrape off one picture to make room for another and you do not mind the loss of the old you live for the new he majesty have no artistic memory he be as young as he be the day that he fling out he first tentative lunette after chaos he be the patron saint of all pilgrim from the city 's struggle where they find no oasis of rest he melt past and family skeleton and hidden story of any kind whatsoever into the blue as a background with the abandon preoccupation of he own brushwork he liege who seek oblivion in the desert need not worry about the water that will never run over the millwheel again or dwell in prophecy on flood to come the omnipotence of the moment transport and soothe they time be nothing say the eternal painter if you feel important remember that man 's hectic bustling make but worm-work on the planet live and breathe joyfully and magnificently do not strain you eye over embroidery come to my open gallery and how do you like the way i set those silver cloud a-tumbling do you know anything better under the dome of any church or capitol shall i bank they line they with purple it be do but no let we wipe it all out change the tint of we background and start afresh with he eleven hundred million billionth sunset or thereabout he majesty hold a man and a woman who have meet on the roof of the world in thrall he be lurid at the outset dip he camel 's hair in at the round furnace door sink toward the hill whose red vortex shot tongue of flame into canyon and crevasse and drive out they lurk shadow with the fire of its inquisition the foliage of little river become a grove of quiver leaf of gold set on a vast beaten platter of gold and the man and the woman like all thing else in the landscape be suffuse in this still parnassian penetrate brilliancy which ought to make even a miser feel that he hoarded eagle and sovereign be ephemeral dross i love it all -- all the desert say mary ewold and i too i have for six year i for five the sentence have strike clearly as answering chime impersonally in they preoccupy gaze it give I life he add and it give I life then they look at each other in mutual surprise and understanding each in wonder that the other have ever be anything but radiant of out-of-doors health that fleck on the lung which bring a doctor 's order have long ago be heal by the physician of the ozone they be breathe and you remain he say and you also she answer they own silence seem to become a thing apart from the silence of the infinite it be as if both recognize a common thought that even the eternal painter could not compel oblivion of the past to which they do not return of the faith of city to which they have be breed but it be one of the eternal painter 's rule that no one of he subject should ask another of he subject why he stay on the desert jack be the first to speak and he voice return to the casual key usually i watch the sunset while we make camp he say i be very late to-night -- late beyond all habit and sunset and sunrise do make one a creature of habit out here firio and my little train will grow impatient wait for I you mean the indian and the burro with the silver bell that come over the pass some time before you of course they belong to he she be think even as she make the inquiry this play cowboy with he absurdly enormous silver spur would naturally put bell on he burro yes i send firio with wrath of god and jag ear on ahead and tell he to wait at the foot of the descent wrath of god will worry -- he be of a worrying nature i must be go in view of the dinosaur nonsense she be already prepare for a variety of inventional talk from he as they start down from the pass in single file she lead the sun sink behind the hill leave the eternal painter unhindered by a furnace glare in the center of the canvas to paint with a thousand brush in the radiant tint of the afterglow you do not like that one o art critic we hear he say well here be another before you have adjust you _ pince-nez _ and i will brush it away before you have emit you first ah i do not criticise i paint -- i paint for the love of it i paint with the pigment of the firmament and the imagination of the universe the two do not talk of that sky which hold they avert glance while know hoof that bear they weight keep the path for how can you talk of the desert sky except in the banality of exclamation it be _ lèse majesté _ to the eternal painter to attempt description at time she look back and they eye meet in understanding as true subject of he majesty and then they look skyward to see what change the master 's witchery have work in supreme intoxication of the sens breathe that dry air which be like cool wine come in long sip to the palate they ride down the wind trail till after a surpass outburst the eternal painter drop he brush for the night it be dusk shadow return to the crevasse free of the magic of the sky with the curtain of night draw in the mighty savagery of the bare mountain in they disdain of man and imagination reassert itself it drop mary ewold from the azure to the reality of pete leddy she be see the smoking end of a revolver and a body lie in a pool of blood and there behind she ride this smile stranger proceeding so genially and carelessly to the fate which she have provide for he with the last turn which bring they level with the plain they come upon a indian a baggage burro and a riding-pony the indian spring up grin : he welcome and doff a mexican steeple-hat i must introduce you all around jack tell mary she observe in he manner something new -- a positive enthusiasm for he three retainer which include a certain well-relished vanity in they loyalty and character firio have sancho panza beat to a frazzle jack say sancho be fat and unresourceful even stupid fancy he broil a quail on a spit fancy what a lot of trouble firio could have save don quixote de la mancha why confound it he would have spoil the story firio be a solid grain to take jack 's view winnow out of bushel of aboriginal chaff a indian all indian without any strain of spanish blood in the primitive southern strain and firio ride wrath of god jack continue nod to a pony with a low-hung head and pendant lip whose lugubrious expression be exaggerate by a scar he look it do not you think -- always miserable whether he nose be in the oats or we run out of water he be we sad philosopher who have just as dependable a gait as pd i have many theory about the psychology of he ego sometimes i explain it by a desire both to escape and to pursue unhappiness which amount to a solemn kind of perpetual motion but he have a positively sweet nature there be no more malice in he professional mournfulness than in the cheerful humor of jag ear it be plain to see which be jag ear she observe and how he earn he name every time a burro get into the corn a indian master cut off a bit of long furry ear as a lesson before jag ear pass into kindlier hand he have be clip closer than a boston terrier only a single upstanding fragment remain in token of a grade education which have avail he nothing there be no curtail jag ear 's curiosity say jack to he everything be worth try that be why he be a bear traveller he have be with I from colorado to chihuahua on all my wanderings back and forth while he speak firio mount wrath of god and with jag ear 's bell jingle the supply division set out on the road jack and mary follow this time ride side by side pony nose to pony nose in a intimacy of association impossible in the narrow mountain trail it be a intimacy signalize by silence there be a end to the mighty transport of the height the well of whimsicality have dry up the weight of the silence seem balance on a brittle thread all the afternoon 's event align themselves in a colossal satire in the half light jack become a gaunt and lonely figure that ought to be confine in some utopian kindergarten mary could feel she temple beat with the fear of what be wait for he in little river now a dark mass on the level just dark without color or any attraction except the mystery that go with the shroud of night she know how he would laugh at she fear for she guess that he be unafraid of anything in the world which however be no protection from pete leddy 's six-shooter i -- i have a right to know -- will not you tell I how you be go to defend yourself against pete leddy she demand in a sudden outburst i have not think of that certainly i shall leave it to pete himself to open hostility i have not think of it because i have be too busy think out how i be go to break a piece of news to firio i have be a awful coward about it put it off and put it off i have plan to do it on my birthday two week ago and then he give I these big silver spur -- spend a whole month 's wages on they think of that i buy this cowboy regalia to go with they you can not imagine how that pleased he it certainly be great fun mary could only shake she head hopelessly firio and jag ear and wrath of god and old pd here -- we have sort of grown use to one another 's foolishness now i can not put it off any longer and i would about as soon be murder as tell he that i be go east in the morning you mean you be go to leave here for good she mistrust she own hearing she be dazzle by this sudden burst of light through the cloud yes by the first train this be my last desert ride why have he not say so at first it would not only have save she from worry but from the humiliation of plead with a stranger doubtless he have enjoy tease she but no matter the affair need not last much longer now she tell herself that if necessary she would mount guard over he for the remain twelve hour of he stay once he be aboard the pullman he would be out of danger she responsibility would be over and the whole affair would become a bizarre memory a incident close back to new york he say as one who enter a fog without a compass back to fight pleosaur dinosaur and all kind of monster he add with a cheeriness which ring with the first false note she have hear from he i do not care he conclude and break into a spanish air whose beat run with the trickle hoof-beat of the pony in the sand that be it she think that explain he just do not care about anything ahead the lamp be begin to twinkle in the little settlement which have send such a contrast in citizenship as mary ewold and pete leddy out to the pass they be approach a single isolate building from the door of which come a spray of light and the sound of man 's voice that be bill lang 's place mary explain he keep a store with a bar in the rear he also have the post-office thanks to he political influence and this be where i have to stop for the mail when i return from the pass she have not speak with any sense of a hint which it be inevitable he should accept let I get it for you and before she have time to protest he have dismount draw rein at the edge of the wooden step she ride past where he pony be stand when he enter the door he tallness and lean ease of posture silhouette in the light she could look in on the group of idle male gossip do not it be a half cry from she hardly audible in a intensity which she know be futile in the surge of she torture self-incrimination why have she not think that it would be here that pete leddy be bind to wait for anyone come in by the trail from galeria the lounger suddenly drop to the cover of box and barrel as a flicker of steel shot upward and behind the gleaming rim of a revolver muzzle hold rigid be a brown hand and leddy 's hard unyielding face what matter if the easy traveller could shoot he be catch like a man come out of a alley he have no chance to draw in turn in the click of a second-hand the thing would be over mary 's eye involuntarily close to avoid see the flash from the revolver she listen for the report for the fall of a body which should express the horror she have visualize for the hundredth time a century seem to pass and there be no sound except the beat of she heart which run in a cataract throb to she temple no sound except that and what seem to be soft regular step on the bare floor of the store coward she tell herself with the agony of she suspense break he save you from inexpressible humiliation and you be afraid even to look she open she eye prepare for the worst have she go out of she head could she no longer trust she own eyesight what she see be inconceivable the startled face of the lounger be rise from behind the box and barrel pete leddy 's gun have drop to he side and he would-be victim have a hand on pete 's shoulder jack be talk apparently in a kindly and reasoning tone but she could not make out he word one man alone evidently have not take cover it be jim galway a rancher who have be stand at the mail counter to judge by he expression what jack be say have he approval with a nod to leddy and then a nod to the other as if in amicable conclusion of the affair jack wheel around to the counter disclose leddy 's face wry with insupportable chagrin he revolver be still in he hand in the swift impulse of one at bay who find himself release he bring it up there be murder murder from behind in the catlike quickness of he movement but jim galway be equally quick he throw he whole weight toward leddy in a catapult leap as he grasp leddy 's wrist and bear it down jack face about in alert readiness see that galway have the situation pat he put up he hand in a kind of question puzzle remonstrance but mary notice that he be very erect he speak and galway speak in answer evidently he be ask that leddy be release to this galway consent at length but without draw back until he have see leddy 's gun safe in the holster then leddy raise himself challengingly on tiptoe to jack who turn to galway in the manner of one extend a invitation on he part leddy turn to ropey smith another of little river ' ruffian after this leddy go through the door at the rear the lounger resume they seat on the cracker barrel and gaze at one another with drop jaw while bill lang proceed with he business as postmaster iv he carry the mail when the suspense be over for mary the glare of the store lamp go dancing in grotesque wave and abruptly uncannily fall away into the distant swimming glow of a lantern suffuse with fog she sway only the leg-rest keep she from slip off the pony she first return sense of she surroundings come with the sound of a voice the same careless pleasant voice which she have hear at galerium ask pete leddy if he be not overplay he part you be right say the voice it be the whistle that make he so angry indistinctly she associate a slowly-shaping figure with the voice and realize that she have be away in the unknown for a second yes it be all very well to talk about sir walter be out of fashion but she have be near to faint and in none of the affectation of the hoop-skirt age either have she do any foolish thing in expression of a weakness that she have never know before have she extend she hand for support have he catch she as she wobble in the saddle no she be relieve to see that he be not near enough for that by no stretch of ethic can you charge

living-room a figure whose muscle run ripple with leanness and suppleness without the bunch over-development of the athlete he bubble in shivery delight with the first frigid sting of the downpour he laugh in ecstasy as he pull the valve wide open invite a niagara while he be still glowing with the rough intimacy of the towel he view the trappings throw over the chair and he revolver holster on the bureau in a sense of detachment as if in the surroundings of civilization some voice of civilization make he wish for flannel in which to dine then there come a rap at the door and a indian appear with a envelope address in feminine handwriting on the corner of the page within be a palm-tree -- a crest to which anybody who dwell on the desert might be entitle and jack read : dear mr wingfield :

role as forensic master of the universe how he do talk he be a mill to which all intellectual grist be welcome over its wheel the water run now singing again with the roar of a cataract he change theme with the relish of one who ramble at will and the emotion of every opinion be write on the big expanse of he feature and enforce with gesture he talk of george washington of andrea del sarto of melon-growing trim pepper-tree the divina commedium fight rose-bug of schopenhauer and of florence -- a great deal about florence a city that seem to hang in he mind as a sort of renaissance background for everything else even for melon-growing you be get over my head jack warn he at time politely that be the trouble say jasper ewold consider the hardship of be the one wise man in the world i find it lonely inconvenient stupefying why i can not even convince jim galway that i know more about dry farming than he jack listen raptly he face glowing once when he look in he host 's direction suddenly after speak to mary he find that he be the object of the same inquire scrutiny that he have be on the porch in lull he catch the old man 's face in repose it have sadness then the sadness of wreckage sadness against which he seem to fence in he wordy feint and thrust christian civilization begin in the tuscan valley the philosopher proceed hark back to the book which have arrive by the evening 's mail florence be a devil -- florence be divine they raise genius and devil and martyr : the most cloud-topping genius the worst devil the most saintly martyr but better than be a drone in a florence pension be all this -- with a wave of he hand to the garden and the star -- which i owe to mary and the little speck on she lung which bring we here after -- after we have find that we have not as much money as we think we have and a old fellow who have be a idle student mostly live abroad all he life feel the cramp of the material fact of board-and-clothes money it make mary well it make I know the fulness of wisdom of the bee and the ant and it bring I back to the spirit of america -- the spirit of youth and accomplishment instead of dream of past city i set out to make a city like a true american here we come to camp in we first travel delight of desert space for she sake and here we bring what be leave of the fortune and start a settlement the spectator-philosopher attitude of audience to the world 's stage pass he become the builder and the rancher enthusiastically dwelling on the growth of orchard and garden in expert fondness as jack listen the fragrance of flower be in he nostril and in interval between jasper ewold 's sentence he seem to hear the rustle of born leaf-frond break the silence but the narrative be not a idyll toil and patience have be the handmaiden of the fecundity of the soil prosperity have bring a entail of problem jasper ewold mention they briefly as if he would not ask a guest to share the shadow which they bring to he brow the honey of we prosperity bring we something besides the bee it bring those who would share the honey without work say he it bring the bill lang hive and pete leddy at the mention of the name jack 's and mary 's glance meet you have promise not to tell hers be say i will not he be answer but clearly he have grasp the fact that little river be get out of its patron 's hand and every honest man in that community want to be rid of pete leddy i should think you old friend cosmo de ' medicus would have find a way jack suggest cosmo be for talk say mary at heart father be a quaker some be for lynching say jasper ewold thoughtfully begin to promote order with disorder and where will you end he inquire belligerently this be not the middle age this be the little river of peace then after a quotation from cardinal newman which seem pretty far-fetched to deal with desert ruffian he be away again set out fruit tree and fight the scale and we date tree wonderful he continue this year we get we first fruit unless the book be wrong you can not realize what this first-born of promise mean to little river under the magic of water it complete the cycle of desert fecundity from scotch oats and irish potato to the arab 's bread banana i do not include never where the banana grow have there be art or literature a good priesthood unimpassioned law-maker honest banker or a noble knighthood it be just a little too warm here we can build a civilization which neither roast we in summer nor freeze we in winter there be a fluid magnetism in the rush of jasper ewold 's junketing verbiage which carry the listener on the bosom of a pleasant stream jack be suddenly remind that it must be very late and he have far overstay the retire hour of the desert where the eternal painter command early rise go -- go so soon protest jasper ewold so late jack smile back to prove that it be he call attention to the fact when they pass through the living-room to the veranda that not a light remain in any ranch-house i have not start my talk yet say jasper but next time you come i will really make a beginning -- and you shall see the date tree wonderful i go by the morning train jack return so so mused jasper so so he object but not gloomily i get a good listener only to lose he but jack be hardly conscious of the philosopher 's word in that interval he have still another glimpse of mary 's eye without the veil and see deeper than he have before saw vast solitude invite yet offer no invitation where bright stream seem to flash and sing under the sunlight and then disappear in a desert that be she farewell to the easy traveller who have stop to do she a favor on the trail and he seem to ask nothing more in that spellbound second nor do he after the veil have fall and he acquit himself of some speak form of thanks for a evening of happiness a pleasant journey mary say luck sir chap luck call jasper ewold jack 's easy stride as he pass out into the night confirm the last glimpse of he smile whimsical i do not care attitude which never mind the danger sign on the precipice 's edge he do not really want to go back to new york mary remark and be surprise to find that she have speak she thought aloud i hardly agree with that opinion say she father absently he thought far afield from the fetter of he word but of one thing i be sure john wingfield a smile and a square chin vi oblivion be not easy a smile and a square chin mary repeat as they go back into the living-room yes have not he both this wingfield ask she father this wingfield -- on the finish of the sentence there be a halt appreciable accent he move toward the table with the listlessness of some enormous automaton of a man to whom every step of existence be a step in a treadmill there be a heavy sadness about he feature which rarely come and always startle she when it do come with a fear that they have so set in gloom that they would never change he raise he hand to the wick screw of the lamp wait for she to pass through the room before turn off the flame which bath he in its ray give he the effect of a rodinesque incarnation of memory any melancholy that beset he be she own enemy to be fight and cajole mary slip to he side drop she head on he shoulder and pat he cheek but this magic which have so frequently rally he bring only a transient hazy smile and in its company what seem a random thought and you and he come down the pass together yes yes he say he tone have the vagueness of one drawing in from the sea a net that seem to have no end have jack wingfield be more than a symbol have he bring something more than a expression of culture manner and ease of a past which nothing could dim have he suggest some personal relation to that past which she father prefer to keep unexplained these question crowd into she mind speculatively they be seek a form of conveyance when she realize that she have be adrift with imagining he be get older she must expect he preoccupation and he absent-mindedness to become more exact yes yes he voice have rise to its customary sonority he eye be twinkle all the hard line have become benignant wrinkle of olympian charm yes yes you and this funny tourist what a desert it be i wonder -- now i wonder if he will go aboard the pullman in that stage costume but come come mary it be bedtime for all pastoral worker and subject of the eternal painter off you go or we shall be play blind-man 's - buff in the dark he be chuckle as he turn down the wick he enormous spur and jag ear and wrath of god he say she fancy run dancing rejoicingly with he mood do not forget the name of he pony she call merrily from the stair it be pd pd say she father with the disappointment of one tempt by a good morsel which he find tasteless there he seem to have descend to alphabetic commonplace no imagery in that he be a slow reliable pony put in mary without the q pretty damn without the quick oh i know slang jasper ewold burst into laughter it be still echo through the house when she enter she room as it die away it seem to sound hollow and veil when the texture of sunny transparent solidity in he laugh be its most pronounced characteristic probably this too be imagination mary think it have be a overwrought day whose event have make inconsiderable thing supreme over logic she always sleep well she would sleep easily to-night because it be so late but she find herself stare blankly into the darkness and she thought range in a shuttle play of incoherency from the moment that leddy have approach she on the pass till a stranger whom she never expect to see again walk away into the night what folly what folly to keep awake over a incident of desert life but be it folly what sublime egoism of isolate provincialism to imagine that it have be anything but a great event naturally quiet desert nerve must still be quiver after the strain inevitably they would not calm instantly particularly as she have take coffee for supper she be wroth about the coffee though she have take less than usual that evening she hear the clock strike one she hear it strike two and three and he on he part -- this sir chap who have come so abruptly into she life and evidently set old passion afire in she father 's mind -- of course he be sleep that be the exasperating phlegm of he he would sleep on horseback ride toward the edge of a precipice a smile and a square chin -- and dreamy vagueness she keep repeat the detail of the scene in the store recur with a vividness which count a flock of sheep as they go over a stile or any other trick for outwit insomnia could not drive from she mind then pete leddy 's final look of defiance and jack wingfield 's attitude in answer rise out of the pantomime in merciless clearness all the indecisiveness of the interchange of guess and rehearsed impression be go she get a message abruptly and convincingly this incident of the pass be not close a ultimatum have be exchange death lay between these two man jack have accept the issue the clock strike four and five before it strike again daylight would have come and before night come again what to lie still in the torment of this new experience of wakefulness with its peculiar half-recognized foreboding have become unbearable she rise and dress and go down stair softly candle in hand aware only that every agitate fiber of she being be whipping she to action which should give some muscular relief from the strain of she overwrought faculty she would go into the garden and walk there wait for sunrise but at the edge of the path she be arrest by a shadow come from the servant ' sleeping-quarter it be ignacio the little indian who care for she horse run errand and fight garden bug for she -- ignacio the note-bearer señorita señorita he exclaim and he voice vibrant with something stronger than surprise have a certain know quality as if he understand more than he dare to utter señorita you rise early sometimes one like to look at the morning star she remark but there be no star only a pale moon as ignacio could see for himself señorita that young man who be here and pete leddy -- do you know señorita the young man who come down from the pass with I you mean she ask inwardly shame at she simulation of casual curiosity yes he and leddy -- bad blood between they ' say ignacio you no know señorita they fight at daybreak the pantomime in the store jack 's form disappear with its easy step into the night analyze in the light of this news become the natural climax of a series of event all under the spell of fatality come ignacio she say we must hurry and she start around the house toward the street vii what happen at lang 's while jack have be play the pioneer of rural free delivery in little river pete leddy in the rear of bill lang 's store be refuse all stimulant but indulge in a unusually large cud of tobacco liquor be not no help in draw a bead he explain to the lounger who follow he through the door after jack have go if pete do not want to drink it be not discreet to press he consider the mood he be in the other take liberal dose which seem only to heighten the detail of the drama which they have witness to mary it have be all pantomime to they it be dynamic with language it be something beyond any previous contemplation of possibility in they cosmos the store have be enjoy a average evening all present be express they undaunted faith in the invincibility of jame j jeffry when a smile stranger appear in the doorway he be dress like a regular cowboy dude he like might have appear on the stage but have never be know to get off a pullman in arizona and the instant he appear up flash pete leddy 's revolver the gang have often discuss when and how pete would get he seventh victim and here they be about to be witness of the deed instinct teach they the proper conduct on such occasion the tenderfoot be as good as dead but be a tenderfoot and naturally a bad shot and prone to excitement he might draw and fire wild they duck with the avidity of woodchuck into they hole -- all except jim galway who remain lean against the counter i gin ye warn they hear pete say and close they eye involuntarily -- all except jim galway -- with they last impression the tenderfoot 's ingenuous smile and the gleam on pete 's gun-barrel they wait for the report as mary have and then they hear step and look up to see that dude tenderfoot still smile go straight toward the muzzle point at he head he hand at he side in no attempt to draw the thing be incredible and supernatural pete be let he come close first they think but there unbelievable as it be pete be lower he revolver and the tenderfoot 's hand be on he shoulder in a friendly explanatory position pete seem in a trance without will-power over he trigger finger and pete be the last man in the world that you would expect to lose he nerve jim galway be the one calm observer whose vision have not be disturb by precipitancy in take cover let we have he version he just walk over to pete -- that be all i can say -- walk over to he simple and calm like he be go to ask for a match all i could think of and see be he smile right into that muzzle and the glint in he eye which be look into pete 's someway you could not shoot into that smile and that glint which be sort of say ` go ahead i be leave it to you and i do not care ' -- just as if a flash of powder be all the same to he as a flash of lightning the desert have give jack life and it would seem as if what the desert have give it might take away he be not go to humble himself by throw up he arm or stand still for execution he be on he way into the store and he continue on he way if something stop he then he would not have to take the train east in the morning now if you want to kill I pete leddy the astonished group hear this stranger say why i be not go to deny you the chance but i do not want you to do it just out of impulse and i know that be not you own reason way you certainly would want sport rule to prevail and that i should have a equal chance of kill you so we will go outside stand off any number of pace you say let we gun-barrel hang down even with the seam of we trousers and wait for somebody to say ` one two three -- fire ' not once have that peculiar smile fade from jack 's lip or the glint in he eye divert from its probe of leddy 's eye he voice go well with the smile and with a undercurrent of high voltage which seem the audible corollary of the glint every man know that despite he gay adornment he be not bluff he have make he proposition in deadly earnest and be ready to carry it out pete leddy shuffle and bite the end of he moustache and he face be draw and white and he shoulder burn under the easy grip of jack 's hand from the bear of the unremitting glance that have confound he he shift he gaze sheepishly oh h -- l he say and the tone in its disgust and its attempt to laugh off the incident give the simplicity of a exclamation from he limited vocabulary its character oh h -- l i be just try you out as a tenderfoot -- a little joke at this all the crowd laugh in a explosive breath of relief the inflection of the laugh make pete go red and look challengingly from face to face with the result that all become piously sober then it be all right i mean in no way to wind you feeling or even you susceptibility say jack and accept the incident as close he turn to the counter and ask for the ewold mail free from that smile and the glint of the eye pete come to in a torrent of reaction he with six notch on he gun-handle have be trifle with by a grin tenderfoot rage mount red to he brow no man who have humiliate he should live he would have shoot jack in the back if it have not be for jim galway lean as a lath lantern-jawed with deep-set blue eye he bear different from that of the other lounger jim have not join in the laugh over pete 's explanation he have remain impassive through the whole scene but the readiness with which he knock leddy 's revolver down show that this immovability have let nothing escape he quiet observation when jack look around and understand what have pass he face be without the smile it be set and he body have stiffen free of the counter i 'll take the gun away from he it be high time somebody do say galway i think you have better if that be

the clamminess of the dew touch mary 's forehead and she hand brush the moisture-laden hedge as she leave the ewold yard she remember that jack have say that he would camp near the station so there be no doubt in which direction she should go hasten along the silent street it be easy for she to imagine that she and ignacio be the only sentient being abroad in a world that have stop breathe softly impalpably with both the graciousness of a host and the determinedness of a intruder who will not be gainsay the first ray of morning light filter into the mist the violet go pink from pale pink it turn to rose-pink to the light of life which be as yet as still as the light of the moon the occasional giant cactus in the open beyond the village outskirts cease to be spectral for the first time mary ewold be in the presence of the wonder of daybreak on the desert without watch for the harbinger of gold in the v of the pass with its revelation of a dome of blue where unfathomable space have be for the first time daybreak interested she only in broaden and define she vision of she immediate surroundings when the permeate softness suddenly yield to full transparency spreading from the fanfare of the rise sun come bolt above the range and the mist rise she leave the road at sight of two pony and a burro in a group they head together in droop fellowship she know they at once for pd wrath of god and jag ear nearby rise a thin spiral of smoke and back of it be a huddle figure firio prepare the morning meal animal and servant be as motionless as the cactus evidently they do not hear she footstep they form a picture of nightly oblivion unconscious that day have come firio 's face be hide by he big mexican hat he do not look up even when she be near she note the two blanket-roll where the two comrade of the trail have sleep she see that both be empty and know that jack have already go where be mr wingfield she demand breathlessly firio be not startle to be startle be hardly in he indian nature the hat tip upward and under the brim-edge he black eye gleam as the sandy soil all around he gleam in the dew he shrug he shoulder when he recognize the lady speaking as the one who have delay he at the foot of the pass the previous afternoon thanks to she he have be leave alone without he master the whole evening he go to stretch he leg answer firio apparently sir chap have be disincline to disturb the routine of camp by tell firio anything about the duel where do he go in which direction mary persist firio move the coffee-pot closer to the fire this seem to require the concentration of all he faculty include that of speech he be a fit servant for one who take duel so casually where where she repeat where have you no tongue snap ignacio firio gaze all around as if look for jack then nod in the direction of rise ground which break at the edge of a depression about fifty yard away she impatience have make the delay of a minute seem hour while the brilliance of the light have now become that of broad day she forget all constraint she run and as she run she listen for a shot as if it be something inevitable past due and then she utter a muffle cry of relief as the scene in a depression which have be the bed of a ancient river flash before she with theatric completeness in the bottom of it be five man two move and three stationary jim galway and ropey smith be walk side by side keep a measured step as they pace off a certain distance while bill lang and pete leddy and jack stand by leddy and lang be watch the process inflexibly jack be in the costume which have flush she curiosity so vividly on the pass and he appear the same amuse disinterested and wonder traveller who have then come upon strange doings she stop she temple throb giddily she breath come in gasp stop to gain mastery of herself before she decide what she would do next on the opposite bank of the _ arroyo _ be a line of head like those of infantry above a parapet and she comprehend that in the same way that news of a cock-fight travel the gallery god of little river have receive a tip of a sport event so phenomenal that it change the sluggard among they into early riser they be make themselves comfortable lie flat on they stomach and expose as little as possible of they precious body to the danger of that tenderfoot firing wild it be a great show of which they would miss no detail and all have they interest whet by some possible new complication of the plot when they see the tall familiar figure of jasper ewold 's daughter standing against the skyline she feel the greedy inquiry of they eye she guess they thought this new element of the situation sweep she with a realization of the punishment she must suffer for that chance meeting on galerium and then with resentful anger which transform jack wingfield 's indifference to callous bravado must she face that battery of leer from the town ruffian while she implore a stranger who have be nothing to she yesterday and would be nothing tomorrow to run away from a combat which be a creation of he own stubbornness she be in revolt against herself against he and against the whole miserable business if she proceed public opinion would involve she in a sentimental interest in a stranger she must live with the story forever while to a idle traveller it be only a adventure at a way-station on he journey she have but to withdraw in feigned surprise from the sight of a scene which she have come upon unaware and she would be free of any association with it for all little river know that she be give to random walk and ride no one would be surprise that she be abroad at this early hour it would be ascribe to the nonsense which afflict the ewold father and daughter about sunrise yes she have be in a nightmare with the light of day she be see clearly have she not warn he about leddy have not she do she part should she submit herself to fruitless humiliation go to he in as much distress as if he existence be she care if he would not listen to she yesterday why should she expect he to listen to she now she would return to she garden its picture of content and isolation call she away from the stare of the face on the other bank she turn on she heel abruptly take two or three spasmodic step and stop suddenly confront with another picture -- one of imagination -- that of jack wingfield lie dead the recollection of a voice the voice that have stop the approach of leddy 's passion-inflamed face to she own on the pass sound in she ear she face around draw by something that will and reason could not overcome to see that jim galway and ropey smith have finish they task of pacing off the distance the two combatant be start for they station they long shadow in the slant of the morning sunlight travel over the sand like pursue spectre leddy go with the quick firm step which bespeak the keenness of he desire jack more slowly at a natural gait he station be so near she that she could reach he with a dozen step and he be whistle -- the only sound in a silence which seem to stretch as far as the desert -- whistle gaily in apparent unconsciousness that the whole affair be anything but play the effect of this be benumb it make she muscle go limp she sink down for very want of strength to keep erect and ignacio hardly observe keep close to she drop at she side ignacio tell the young man the one who be we guest last evening that i wish to see he she gasp with flicker shrewd eye ignacio have watch she distress he crave the word that should call he to service and be off with a bind he rush agitate figure be precipitate into a scene hard set as man on a chess-board in deadly serenity leddy and jack be already face each other señor señor ignacio shout as he run señor do not care of the big spur -- wait the message which he have to give be he mistress 's and therefore nobody else 's business he rise on tiptoe to whisper it into jack 's ear jack listen with head bent to catch the word he look over to mary for a instant of intent silence and then raise he empty left hand in signal sorry but i must ask for a little delay he call to leddy he tone be wonderful in its politeness and he bow considerately to he adversary i think it be all bluff leddy answer you 'll get it though -- you 'll get it in the old way if you have not the nerve to take it in yours really i be stubbornly fond of my way jack say i shall be only a minute that will give you time to steady you nerve he add in the encouraging reassure strain of a coach to a man go to the bat he be come toward mary with he easy languid gait radiant of casual inquiry the time of he step seem to be reckon in succeed hammer-beat in she brain he be come and she have to find reason to keep he from go back because if it have not be for she he would be quite safe oh if she could only be free of that idea of obligation to he all the pain the confusion the embarrassment be on she side he very manner of approach in keep with the whole story of he conduct toward she show he incapable of such feeling she have another reaction she devoutly wish that she have not send for he have not he own perversity take he fate out of she hand if he prefer to die why should it be she concern should she volunteer herself as a rescuer of fool the gleaming sand of the _ arroyo _ rise in a dazzling mist before she eye obscure he clothing he with the unreality of a dream and then in physical reality he emerge he be so near as she rise spasmodically that she could have lay she hand on he shoulder he hat under he arm he stand smile in the bland question interest of a spectator happen along the path even as he have in she first glimpse of he on the pass i do not care go on go on she be go to say you have make sport of I you make sport of everything life itself be a joke to you the tempest of the word be in she eye if it do not reach she tongue 's end it be halt by the look of hurt surprise of real pain which appear on he face be it possible after all that he could feel the thought bring forth the passionate cry of she mission after that sleepless night i beg of you -- i implore you -- do not have anyone tell she yesterday that she would have be beg any man in melodramatic supplication for anything she would have think of herself as mad be not she mad be not he mad yet she break into passionate appeal it be horrible -- unspeakable i can not bear it a flood of color sweep he cheek and with it come a peculiar feminine almost awkward gentleness he air be that of wordless humility he seem more than ever a uncomprehending sure prey for leddy do not you realize what death be she ask the question so earnest and search have the contrary effect on he it change he back to he careless self he laugh in the way of one who deprecate another 's illusion or pass fancy this add to she conviction that he do not realize that he be incapable of realize he position do you think i be about to die he ask softly with pete leddy firing at you twenty yard away -- yes and you pose -- you pose if you be human you would be serious pose he repeat the word it startle he mystify he the clothes i buy to please firio you mean he inquire he face lighting no about death it be horrible -- horrible death for which i be responsible why have you forget that we settle all that he ask it be not you it be the habit i have form of whistle in the loneliness of the desert i be sorry now that i do not stick to singing even at the expense of a sore throat now he call to leddy and he voice high-pitched and powerful seem to travel in the luminous air as on resilient invisible wire leddy be not it the way i whistle to you the first time we meet that make you want satisfaction you remember -- and he break into a whistle he tone be different from that to leddy on the pass the whistle be different it be shrill and mock yes the whistle yell leddy no man can whistle to I like that and live jack laugh as if he appreciate all the possibility of humor inherent in the picture of the bloodthirsty leddy the wait seconds and the gallery he turn to mary with a gesture of he outstretched hand : there you see i bring it on myself you be brutal you be without feeling -- you be ridiculous -- you -- she storm chokingly and in face of this he become reasoning philosophical yes i admit that it be all ridiculous even to farce this little _ comédie humaine _ but we must remember that beside the age of the desert none of we last long ridiculous yes but if i will whistle why then i must play out the game i have start he be look straight into she eye and there be that in he gaze which come as a surprise and with something of the effect of a blade out of a scabbard it chill she it fasten she inactive to the earth with a helplessness that be uncanny it mix the element of fear for he with the element of fear of he remember i be of age -- and i do not mind he add with the faintest glint of satire in he reassurance he be walk away with a wave of he hand to leddy he be go over the precipice 's edge after thank the danger sign he do not hasten nor do he loiter the precipice resolve itself into a incident of a journey of the same order as a ankle-deep stream trickle across a highway ix the devil be out she have do she best and she have fail what reason be there for she to remain should she endure witness in reality the horror which she have picture so vividly in imagination a flash of fire the fall of a careen figure to the earth leddy 's grin of satisfaction the rejoicing of he clan of spectator over the exploit while youth which sing air to the beat of a pony 's hoof and know the worship of the eternal painter lay dead what reason to remain except to punish herself she would go but something banish reason she be hold in the leash of suspense stare with clearness of vision in one second stare into a mist the next while the come and go of ignacio 's breath between he tooth be the only sound in she ear señor do not care of the big spur will win he whisper he will she repeat like one marvelling in the tautness of every nerve and muscle that she have the power of speech she peer into ignacio 's face its indian impassivity be go he lip be twitch he eye be burn point between half-closed lid why she ask how i know i watch he i have see a mountain lion asleep in a tree he paw be like velvet he smile there seem no fight in he i know there be a devil a big devil in señor do not care it sleep so much it very terrible when it awake and pete leddy -- he be all the time awake all the time too ready something in he will make he arm shake when the moment to shoot come and something in señor do not care -- he devil -- will make he arm steady could ignacio be right do jack really know how to shoot be he confident of the outcome be he smile the mask of a conviction that he be to kill and not to be kill after all have he attitude toward she be merely act have she undergo this humiliation as the fish on the line of the mischievous play of one who have stop over a train in order to do murder no if he be capable of such guile he know that leddy could shoot well and that twenty yard be a deadly range for a good shot he be take a chance and the devil in he be laugh at the chance while it laugh at she for think that he be a innocent go to slaughter in expression of a capricious sense of chivalry he will win -- he will win if leddy play fair ignacio repeat now she be tell herself that it be solely for the sake of she conscience that she want to see señor do not care survive solely for the sake of she conscience that she want to see he go aboard the train safe after that she could forget ever have owe this trifler the feeling of gratitude for a favor do literally he must live in order to be a dead and unremembered incident of she existence and jack be back at he station with the bright sunlight heighten the color of he play cowboy attire he weight on the ball of he right foot throw well ahead of the other he head up but the whole effect languid even deferential he seem about to take off he hat to the joyous sky of a fair day in may he shadow express the same feeling as he pose that of tranquil youth with its eye on the horizon leddy have the peculiar slouch of the desperado which be associate with the spread of pioneering civilization by the raucous crier of red-blooded individualism if jack 's bearing be amateurish then pete 's be professional in its threatening pose and he shadow like himself have a unrelieved hardness of outline both draw they gun from they holster and lower they till the barrel lay even with the trousers seam they await the word to fire which bill lang who stand at a angle equidistant from the two man be to give wait jack call in a tone which indicate that something have recur to he then a half laugh from he fall on the brilliant shine hard silence with something of the sound of a pebble slip over glare ice leddy it have just occur to I that we be both foolish -- honestly we be he say the idea when arizona be so sparsely settle of we start out to depopulate it in such a premeditated manner on such a beautiful morning and all because i be such a inept whistler why if i have realize what a perfectly bad whistler i be i would never have whistle again if my whistle hurt you feeling i be sorry and i -- no you do not yell leddy i have wait long enough it be fight you -- oh all right you be so emphatic jack answer he voice be still pleasant but shoot with something metallic the very shadow of he seem to stiffen with the stiffening of he muscle ready call bill lang the ruling passion that have carve six notch on he gun-handle overwhelm pete leddy at least let we give he the benefit of the doubt and say that this and not calculation be responsible for he action before the word for preparation be free of lang 's lip and without wait for the word to fire he revolver come up in a swift quarter-circle he be sure of he aim at that range with a ready draw again and again he have thus hit he target in practice and six time he have wing he man by such agile promptness with the flash from the muzzle all the member of the gallery rise on hand and knee they be as sure that there be to be a seventh notch as of they identity there be no question in they mind but pete have play a smart trick they have know from the first that he would win and the proof of it be in the sudden uncontrollable movement of the adversary jack whirl half round he be fall but even as he fall he be still face he adversary he plunge forward unsteadily and come to rest on he left elbow a trickle of blood show on the chap of he left leg which have tighten as he knee twist under he leddy 's rage have be so hot that for once he trigger finger have be too quick he have aim too low but he be sure that he have do for he man and he look triumphantly toward the gallery god whose hero he be they have now rise to they foot in answer to they congratulation he wave he left hand palm out in salutation he gun-hand have drop back to he trousers seam even as it drop jack 's revolver have rise he own gun-hand steady in the palm of he left hand which have a elbow in the sand for a rest victor and spectator in they preoccupation with the relief and elation of a drama finish have they first warning of what be to come in a voice that do not seem like the voice of the tenderfoot as they have hear it but of another man and leddy be look at a black hole in a rim of steel which though twenty yard away seem hot against he forehead while he turn cold now pete leddy do not move a muscle jack tell he pete leddy you do not play my way i still have a shot due and i be go to kill you jack 's face seem never to have wear a smile it be all chin and thin tightly-pressed lip and solid straight nose bronze and unyielding and i be go to kill you this be surely the devil of ignacio 's imagery speaking in he -- a cold passionless gray-eyed devil though they have never see he shoot everybody feel now that he could shoot with deadly accuracy and that there be no play cowboy in he present mood he have the bead of death on leddy and he would fire with the first flicker of resistance he call seem to have sink the foot of everyone beneath the sand to bed-rock and rivet they there lang and the two seconds be as motionless as statue mary recall leddy 's leer at she on the pass with its intent of something more horrible than murder savagery rise in she heart it be right that he should be kill he deserve he fate but no sooner be the savagery bear -- bear she feel of the very hypnosis of that carve face -- than she cast it out shudderingly in the realization that she have wish the death of a fellow human be she look away from jack and then it occur to she that he must be bleed he be again a companion of the trail he strength ebb away she impulse be retard by no fear of the gallery now it bring she to she foot but first drop you revolver she hear jack call as she run she see it fall from leddy 's tremble hand as a dead leaf go free of a breeze-shaken limb all the fight be out of he the courage of six notch be not the courage to accept in stoicism the penalty of foul play and that black rim be burn he forehead galway you have a gun jack ask yes galway answer mechanically he presence of mind which have be so sure in the store be somewhat shake he have see man kill but never in such deliberate fashion take it out ' there be a quality in the command like frosty madness which one instinctively obey the half-prostrate figure of the tenderfoot seem to dominate everything -- man earth and air mary have a glimpse of galway draw a automatic pistol from he pocket when she drop at jack 's side she know that jack have not hear or see she approach all he will be flow out along a pistol 's sight even as he blood be flow out on the sand in a broaden circle of red it be well that she have come she finger be splash as she feel for the artery which she close by lean she whole weight on the thumb ignacio have follow she and immediately after he come firio who have be startle in he breakfast preparation by the sound of a shot and have set out to investigate its cause he be as change as he master a twitch fierce be glaring at she and at the wound and then prolongedly and watchfully at pete leddy can you shoot to kill jack ask galway in a piercing summons yes drawl galway then up with you gun -- quick there a bead on ropey smith galway have the bead before ropey could protest give ropey ten seconds to drop he gun or we will care for he at the same time as pete ' jack conclude ropey do not wait the ten seconds he be over-prompt for the same reason of temperament that make pete leddy prefer he own way of fight i take it that we can count on the neutrality of we spectator they can not be interested in the success of either side jack observe with dry humor but still methodically all they ask be a spectacle yes you bet come a voice from the gallery undisguisedly eager to concur now pete and ropey jack begin and break off there be a poignant silence that wait on the process of he mind not only be there no sound but to mary there seem no movement anywhere in the world except the pulse of the artery try to drive its flood past the barrier of she thumb jack keep he bead unremittingly on pete it be firio who break the silence kill he he be bad he hate you say firio _ sí sí _ if you do not kill he now you must some time say ignacio mary feel that even if jack hear they he would not let they advice influence he on the bank before she have hasten to he a strange and awful visitor in she heart have wish for leddy 's death now she wish for he to go away unharmed she wish it in the name of she own responsibility for all that have happen yet she tongue have no urge word to offer she wait in a supernatural and dreadful curiosity on jack 's decision it be as if he be to answer one more question in explanation of the mystery of he nature could he deliberately shoot down a unarmed man be he that hard i be think just how to deal with you pete and ropey jack proceed as i understand it you have not be very useful citizen of little river you can live under one condition -- that you leave town and never return armed half a minute to decide i 'll go say pete i 'll go say ropey and keep you word yes they assent but neither move the fact that jack have not yet lower he revolver make they cautious they be obviously over-anxious to play safe to the last then go call jack pete and ropey slouch away leave behind ropey 's gun which be unimportant as it have only one notch and pete 's precious companion of many campaign with its six notch lie on the sand and gentleman jack call to the spectator we little entertainment be over now i be afraid that you will be late for breakfast apparently it come as a real inspiration to all at once that they might be for they begin to withdraw with a celerity that be amazingly spontaneous they head disappear below the skyline and only the actor be leave pete and ropey -- bill lang follow -- walk away along the bed of the _ arroyo _ instead of go over the bank pete pause when he be out of range the old threat be again in he pose i be not through with you yet he call why i hope you be jack answer he let he revolver fall with a convulsion of weakness mary wonder if he be go to faint she wonder if she herself be not go to faint in a giddy second while the red spot on the sand shape itself in revolve grotesquery but the consciousness that she must not lift she weight from the artery be a center idea to keep she faculty in some sort of equilibrium he be look around at she she know now she must see he face after this transformation in he which have make she fear of he competency silly imagining after she have link she name with he in a overwhelming village sensation she be stricken by unanalyzable emotion and by a horror of she nearness to he she contact with he very blood and he power she be conscious of a glimpse of he turn profile still transfix with the cool purpose of action then they be gaze full at each other eye into eye directly questioningly he be smile as he have on the pass as he have when he stand with he arm full of mail wait for the signal to deposit he load he devil have slip back into he inner be he speak first and in the voice that go with he vaguest mood the voice in which he have describe he escape from the dinosaur whose scale have become wedge in the defile at the critical moment you have a strong thumb and it must be tire as well as all bluggy he say fall into a childhood symbol for take the whole affair in play could he be the same man who have say i be go to kill you so relentlessly he have ease the situation with the ready gift he have for ease situation but at the same time he have make those unanalyzable emotion more complex though they be sweep into the background for the moment he glance down at he leg with comprehend surprise now certainly you be free of all responsibility he add you keep the strength in I to escape the fate you fear jim galway will make a tourniquet and relieve you the first available thing for tighten the tourniquet be the barrel of pete leddy 's gun and the first suggestion for material come from she it be the sash of she gown which galway knot with he strong sunburned finger when she could lift she numbed thumb from its task and rise to she foot she have a feeling of relief as if she be free of magnetic bond and uncanny personal proximity the incident be close -- surely close she be breathe a prayer of thanks when a remark from galway to jack bring back she apprehension i guess you will have to postpone catch to-day 's train he say certainly jack must remain until he wound have heal and he strength have return and where would he go he could not camp out on the desert as jasper ewold have the most commodious bungalow it seem natural that any wounded stranger should be take there the idea chill she as a insupportable intrusion jack hesitate a moment he be evidently consider whether he could not still keep to he program yes jim i be afraid i shall have to ask you for a cot for a few day he say finally again he have the right thought at the right moment have he surmise what be pass in she mind see that you have get pete leddy out of town i should say that you be fairly entitle to a whole bed jim drawl these two indian here can make a hustle to get some kind of a litter now she could go that be she one cry thought : she could go and again he come to she rescue with he smile considerateness you have miss you breakfast i 'll warrant he say to she please do not wait you be so brave and cool about it all and -- i -- a faint tide of color rise to he cheek which have be pale from loss of blood for once he seem unable to find a word mary deny he any assistance in he embarrassment yes she answer almost bluntly then she add a excuse : and you should have a doctor at once i will send he she do not look at jack again but hasten away when she be over the bank of the _ arroyo _ out of sight she put she finger to she temple in strong pressure that pulse make she think of another which have be under she thumb and she withdraw she finger quickly it be the sun i have no hat she say to herself and i do not sleep well x mary explain dr patterson be still asleep when mary rap at he door have arouse he to action by call out that a stranger have be wound in the _ arroyo _ she do not pause to offer any further detail with she eye level and dull she walk rapidly along the main street where nobody be yet abroad she one thought to reach she room uninterrupted as she approach the house she see she father standing on the porch he face beam with the joy of a serenely-lived moment as he have he morning look at the eternal painter 's first display for the day she have cross the bridge before he become conscious of she presence mary you be up first out so early when you go to bed so late he greet she i do not sleep well she explain what mary you not sleep well all the preoccupation with the heaven go from he eye which sweep she from head to foot mary you hand be cover with blood there be blood on you dress ' what do this mean she look down and for the first time see dark red spot on she skirt the sight send a shiver through she which she master before she speak oh nothing -- or a good deal if you put it in another way a real sensation for little river she say but you be not tell it be such a remarkable story father it ought not to be spoil by give away its plot she say with assume lightness i do not feel equal to do full justice to it until after i have have my bath i will tell you at breakfast that be a reason for you wait for I and she hasten past he into the house be it -- be it something to do with this wingfield he call excitedly after she yes about the fellow of the enormous spur -- señor do not care as ignacio call he she answer from the stair some note underneath she nonchalance seem to disturb even to distress he he enter the house and start through the living-room on he way to the library but he pause as if in answer to a call from one of the four photograph on the wall michael angelo 's young david in the supple ease of grace the david which michael make from a imperfect piece of marble the david which sculptor say be ill-proportioned the david into which however the master breathe the thing we call genius in the bloom of he own youth find its power even as david find he against goliath this david have come out of the unknown over the hill with the dew of morning freshness on he brow he be unconscious of self of everything except that he be unafraid if all other aspirant have fail in down the old champion why he will try now jasper ewold frown at david as if he be get no answer to a series of question i must make a change you have be up a long time david he think for he have many of these photograph which he keep in a special store-room subject to he pleasure in hang yes i will have a madonna -- two madonna perhaps and a velasquez and a rembrandt next time in the library he set to read professor

throw giuccaminus on the table i 'll make my own opinion nothing else to do out here on the desert time enough to change they as often as i want too he go into the garden -- the garden which next to mary be the most intimate thing in he affection usually every new leaf that have burst forth over night set itself in the gelatine of he mind like so many letterpress change on a print page to a proof-reader this time however a new palm leaf a new spray of bougainvillea blossom a bud on the latest rise setting which he have from lo angele say good morning without any response from he he pace back and forth he hand clasp behind he he head bow moodily and he shoulder draw together in a way that make he seem older and more portly with each turn he look sharply impatiently toward the door of the house never have mary so feel the charm of she room as on this morning never have it seem so set apart from the world and so personal it be the breadth of the ell and the size of she father 's library and bedroom combine the window could hardly be call window in a northern sense for there be no glass it be unnecessary to seal up the source of light and air in a dry climate where a blanket at night supply all the extra warmth one 's body ever require the blind swing inward and the shades soften the light and add to the privacy which the screen of the grow young tree and creep vine be fast supply here she could be more utterly alone than on the summit of the pass itself she pause in the doorway survey familiar object in the enjoy triumph of complete seclusion while she wait for the water to run into the bowl she look fixedly at the stain of a fluid which have be so warm in its touch it be only blood she tell herself it would wash off and she hold she hand in the water and see the spread of the dye through the bowl in a moment of preoccupation then she scrub as vigorously as if she be bent on remove the skin itself after she have hold up she drip finger in satisfied inspection the spot on she gown catch she eye for a moment they too hold she stare attention then she slip out of the gown precipitately with this she determine haste be at a end she be about to enjoy the feminine luxury of time the comb of she hair become a delightful and leisurely function in the silky feel of the strand in she finger and the refreshing pull at the root the flow of the bath water make the music of pleasurable anticipation and immersion set the very spirit of physical life leap and tingle in she vein and all the while she be think of how to fashion a narrative when she start down-stair she be not only refresh but remake she be go to breakfast at the usual hour after the usual process of usher herself from the night 's rest into the day 's activity there have be no stealthy trip out to the _ arroyo _ no duel no wound no señor do not care she have only a story which involve all these element a most preposterous story to tell now you shall hear all about it she

explain well we 'll call he this sir chap this señor do not care or whatever you please as for he walk into the gun there be nothing remarkable in that you draw on a man you expect he to throw up he hand or reach for he gun he do nothing but smile right along the level of the sight into you eye it be disturb to pete 's sense of etiquette on such occasion it throw he off there be similar instance in history a soldier once put a musket at bonaparte 's head some of caesar 's legionary once press they sword at he breast such old hand in human psychology have the presence of mind to smile and the history of the west be full of example which have not be record go on mary ignacio say he have a devil in he she add that little indian have a lot of primitive race wisdom probably he be right she

another that could kill jasper 's word come slowly and with a draw exactness they form the inquiry of one who expect corroboration of a impression yes you feel it -- you feel it very definitely mary yes she be live over the moment of jack 's transformation from silk to steel the scene in the _ arroyo _ become burn clear under the strain of the suppression of she own excitement concentrate in she purpose to make all the realism of the duel a absurdity she do not watch keenly for the sign of expression by which she usually know what be pass in she father 's mind but she be not too preoccupy to see that he be relieve over she assent that there be a devil in jack wingfield which strike she as a puzzle in keep with all that morning 's experience it add to the inward demoralization which have

high-pitched exclamation of realization that she have not to go on with explanation we singular cavalier be safe she say my debt be pay i need not worry any further lest someone who do I a favor should suffer for it true true jasper 's outburst of laughter when he have pause in turn down the wick of the lamp the previous evening have be as a forced blast from the brass anyone with strong lung

then come as a cataract of spontaneity exactly mary the duel provide the way to pay a debt he say why it be you who have do we big spur a favor he have a wound to show to he friend in the east i be

light diet he expostulate and i be stuff to the brim i 'll make you some float island say mr galway refuse to strike she color that be not fill and pass the time jack admit jim say if you have to fletcherize on float island you would starve to death and you tooth would get so use to miss a step on the stair that they would never be able to deal with real victuals at all mr galway jack observe

companion i never have to listen to you in order that i may in turn have my say _ sí _ say firio he lean on the windowsill he black eye shine with ingenuous and flattering appeal : i will broil you a quail on a spit he whisper it be better than stove cooking do not talk of that jack exclaim almost sharply the suggestion bring a swift change to sadness over he face and draw a veil of vagueness over he eye no firio and i 'll tell you why : the odor of a quail broil on a spit belong at the end of a day 's journey when you camp in sight of no habitation you should sit on a dusty blanket-roll you should eat by the light of the ember or a gutter candle no firio we 'll wait till some other day and it be not exactly courtesy to we hostess to bring in provender from the outside the trail have apparently teach firio all the mood of he master he know when it be unwise to persist _ sí _ he whisper and withdraw jack look at galerium and then back quickly as if resist its call he smile half wryly and readjust he position in the chair over the hedge he could see the head and shoulder of passer-by jim galway have come into the room when jasper ewold 's broad back and great head hove in sight with something of the steady majesty of progress of a full-rigged ship the doge jack exclaim brighten jim be take unaware be it the name of a new kind of semi-tropical fruit not yet introduce into arizona not the doge of venice -- hardly when mr ewold 's love run to florence the doge of little river why the doge -- of course jim be on now and grin i do not think of my history at first that be a good one for jasper ewold o doge of little river i expect you in a gondola of state say jack with a playfully grandiloquent gesture as jasper 's abundance fill the doorway but it be all the more compliment to I that you should walk doge eh jasper taste the word pooh he say persiflage persiflage i see at once yesterday that you have a weakness for it and miss ewold how be she jack ask remember the promise that mary have exact from he he take care not to refer to she part in the duel he question fall aptly for what jasper have to say be a man use to keep the gate ever open to the full flood of spontaneity he become stilted in the repetition of anything he have think out and rehearse he be overcheerful without the mellowness of tone which give he cheer its charm on the previous evening she be not a bit the worse why she go for a ride out to the pass this afternoon as usual i have have the whole story from the pass till the minute that jim put the tourniquet on you leg she recognize the great kindness you do she not a kindness -- a inevitable interruption by any passer-by jack put in naturally she feel that it be a kindness a service and when she know you be in danger she act promptly for herself with a desert girl 's self-reliance when it be all over she see the whole thing in its proper perspective as a unpleasant preposterous piece of barbarism which have turn out fortunately oh i be glad of that jack exclaim in relief that speak rejoice in every fiber i have worry i have fear lest i have insist too much on go on but i have to and i know that it be a scene that only man ought to witness -- so horrible i fear it might leave a disagreeable impression ah mary have courage and humor she see the ridiculous she laugh at it all now laugh asked jack yes it be laughable and he break into laughter in which jasper join thunderously jasper keep on laugh after jack stop and in genuine relief to find that the affair be to be as uninfluence a chapter in the easy traveller 's life as in mary 's we regret be that we may have delay you sir jasper proceed you may have have to postpone a important engagement i understand that you have plan to take the train this morning when one have be in the desert for a long time jack answer a few day more or less hardly matter in the time of he departure in a week dr patterson say that i may go meanwhile i shall have the pleasure of get acquaint with little river which otherwise i should have miss i be glad jasper ewold exclaim with dramatic quickness glad that you wound be so slight -- glad that you need not be shut up long when you be due elsewhere what book should he bring to the invalid to while away the time the three musketeer or cyrano jack seem to know he cyrano so well that a copy could be only a prompt he settle deeper in he chair and more to the sky than to jasper ewold repeat cyrano 's address to he cadet set to a tune of he own he body might be in the chair with a bandaged leg but clearly he mind be away on the trail yes let I see he say come back to earth i should like the ` road to rome ' something of charle lamb aldrich 's ` story of a bad boy ' heine -- but no what be i say bring I any solid book on economics i ought to be read economics economics and charle lamb that will do do you think they could travel together all print thing can if you choose i 'll include lamb and any daudet lie loose jack add and omar i carry omar in my head thank you o doge sir chap of the enormous spur you have a broad taste for one who ride over the pass of galeria after five year in arizona say the doge as he rise he be covertly survey that soft win dreamy profile which have turn so hard when the devil that be within come to the surface i be feed on book and gallery in my boyhood jack say but with a reticence that indicate that this be all he care to tell about he past xii mary bring tribute every resident except the crony of pete leddy consider it a duty once a day at least to look over the galway hedge and ask how señor do not care be do that be everyone with a single exception which be mary jack have never see she even pass the house it be as if he very existence have drop out of she ken the town remark the anomaly you have not be in lately mrs galway remind she my flower have require a lot of attention also i have be ride out to the pass a good deal she answer and change the subject to geranium for the very good reason that she have just be weed she geranium bed mr galway look at she strangely and mary catch the glance she guess what mr galway be think : that she have be a little inconsiderate of a man who have be wound in she service probably it be time i bear tribute too she say to herself that afternoon she take down a glass of jelly from the pantry shelf and set forth in the line of duty frowning and rehearse a presentation speech as she go with every step toward the galway cottage she be increasingly confused and exasperated with herself for even think of a speech as she draw near she hear a treble chorus of oh and ah and see jack on the porch surround by child it be dinosaur foolishness again she think pungently he be in the full fettle of nonsense he head a little to one side and lower while he look through he eyebrow at he hearer measure the effect of he word she think of that face when he call to leddy i be go to kill you and feel the pulse of inquiry beat over all that lay in this man 's repertory between the two mood then count each one in he big deep bass voice like this he be say that funny little dwarf keep drop orange out of the tree on the big giant who could not wiggle and be squeak in protest in he little old woman 's voice every orange hit he right on the bridge of he nose and he be say : ` you know i never could bear yellow it fuss I so ' he do not need any jelly i be go on mary think then jack see a slim pliant form hastening by and a brown profile under hair bare of a hat with eye straight ahead mary might have be a unit of march infantry the story stop abruptly yes -- and -- and -- go on cry the child jack hold up he hand for silence how do you do he call and she catch in he tone and in she first glimpse of he face a certain mischievousness as if he who miss no point for idle enjoyment of any situation have a satisfaction in take she by surprise with he greet this put she on she mettle with the quickness of a summons to fence she be as nonchalant as he and you be do well i learn she answer oh come in and hear it miss ewold it be the best one yet cry belvedere smith and -- and -- and -- and -- begin the chorus mary go to the hedge she drop the glass of jelly on the thick carpet of the privet i have just bring my gift i 'll leave it here belvy will bring it when the story be over i be glad you be recover so rapidly and -- and -- insist the chorus you ought not to miss this story it be a regular jim dandy belvedere shout yes will not you come in jack beg in serious urgency i pride myself that it be almost intellectual toward the close i have no doubt she say look fairly at he from under she hand which she hold up to shade she face so he see only the snap of she eye in the shadow but i be in a hurry and he be look at a shoulder and a quarter profile as she turn away do you make the jelly yourself he call yes i be not afraid of the truth -- i do she answer with a backward glance and not stop oh bully he exclaim with great enthusiasm in which she detect a strain of what she classify as impudence but all the time the giant be fumble in he pocket for he green handkerchief you know the dwarf do not like green it fuss he just as much as yellow fuss the giant but it be a narrow pocket so narrow that he could only get he big thumb in and very deep so you see -- and she hear the tale proceeding as she walk on to the end of the street where she turn around and come back across the desert and through the garden on the way she find it amusing to consider jack judicially as a human exhibit strip of all the chimera of romance with which little river have clothe he personality if he have not happen to meet she on the pass the townspeople would have regard this stranger as a invasion of real life by a character out of a comic opera she view the specimen under a magnifying glass in all angle turn it around as if it be a bronze or a ivory statuette 1 in he favor : firstly child be fond of he but he extravagance of phrase and love of applause account for that secondly firio be devote to he such worshipful attachment on the part of a native indian to any saxon be remarkable yet this be explain by he love of color he foible for the picturesque he vagabond irresponsibility and mostly by he latent savagery -- which she would hardly have be willing to apply to ignacio 's worshipful attachment to herself 2 against he : everything of any importance except in the eye of child and savage everything in logic he would not stand analysis at all he be without definite character he be pose affected pleased with himself superficial and theatrical and interested in people only so long as they amuse he or gratify he personal vanity i have the best of the argument in leave the jelly on the hedge and that be the last i shall hear of it she conclude not so mrs galway come that evening a bearer of message he say it be the most wonderful jelly that ever be say mr galway he eat half the glass for dinner and be save the rest for breakfast -- i be use he own word and you know what a killing way he have of put thing -- save it for breakfast so that he will have something to live through the night for and in the morning the joy of it will not be all a memory he want to know if you have any more of the same kind yes a dozen glass mary return tell he we be glad of the opportunity of finish last year 's stock and i send it provide he eat half a glass with every meal i do not know what he answer will be to that say mr galway contract she brow studiously at mary but he would have one quick he always have he be so poetic and all that we be plan to go to the station to see he off and pelt he with flower and dr patterson be go to fashion a white cat out of white carnation with deep red one for the black stripe for the child to present hurrah exclaimed mary blithely and go for the jelly she be spare further bulletin on the state of health of the wound until she father return from he daily call the next morning she be in the living-room and she know by he step on the porch vigorous yet light that he be uplift by good news or by the anticipation of the exploitation of some new idea -- a pleasure second only to that of the idea 's birth such be he elation that he break one of he own rule by toss some of the book loan to jack onto the broad top of the table of the living-room which be sacred to the isolation of the ivory paper-knife he have name the date shout the doge he go by to-morrow 's train it will be a gala affair almost a historical moment in the early history of this community i be to make a speech present he with the freedom of the whole world between we we have hit on a proper modern symbol of the gift he slip I he pullman ticket and i formally offer it to he as the key to the hospitality of the seven sea the two hemisphere and the teem city that lie beyond the range it will be great fun with plenty of persiflage and mary they suggest that you write some verse -- ridiculous verse in keep with the whole nonsensical business you mean that i be to stand on the platform and read poetry dedicate to he she demand poetry mary you grow ambitious not poetry -- foolish doggerel or someone will read it for you he have not fail to watch the play of she expression she have receive all he nonsense announce in he best style of simulated forensic grandeur with a certain unchanging serenity which be unamused : which be indeed barely interested and someone else shall write it for i do not think of any verse she say with a slight shrug of the shoulder besides i shall not be there not be there people will remark you absence will they she ask thoughtfully as if that have not occur to she no they will be too occupy with the persiflage i be go to ride out to the pass in the morning very early -- before daybreak but -- he be positively frolicsome as he catch she hand and wave they back and forth while he rock he shoulder -- when you be stubborn mary have you way i will make you excuse and i to work now it be the hour of the hoe as he call all hour except those of darkness and the hot midday for jasper ewold be no idler in the affair of he ranch or of the town few city man be so busy he everlasting talk be incidental like the babbling of a brook which however keep steadily flow on and the store scholarship of he mind be supplement by long evening with no other relaxation but read now as he go down the path he break into song and when the doge sing it be something awful excusable only by the sheer happiness that bring on the attack mary have important sewing which this morning she choose to do in she room rather than in she favorite spot in the garden she close the shutter on the sunny side and sit down by the window nearest the garden peculiarly sensible of the soft light and cool spaciousness of a inner world the occasional buzz of a bee the flutter of the leaf of the poplar might have be the voice of the outer world in southern spain or southern italy or anywhere else where the air be balmy and to-morrow out to galerium in the fervor of a pilgrim to some shrine with the easy movement of she pony and the rigid line of the pass gradually draw nearer and the sky ever distant she would be mistress of she thought in all the silent glamour of morning on the desert she would hear the train stop at the station its heavy effort as it pull out and watch it wind over the flash steel thread in a clamor of stridency and harshness which grow fainter and fainter and she would smile as it disappear around a bend in the range she would smile at he at the incident just as carelessly as he have smile when he tell of the dinosaur xiii a journey on crutch the sun become benign in its afternoon slant little river be begin to move after its siesta with the stretch of muscle that would grow more vigorous as evening approach and freshen life come into the air with the sprinkle of sunset brilliance to jack the hour palpably bring a reminder of the misery of the moment when a thing long postpone must at last be perform the softness of speculative fancy fade from he face he lip tighten in a way that seem to bring he chin into prominence in mastery of he be as he call firio he voice unusually high-pitched he do not look out at pd and wrath of god and jag ear firio come with the eagerness of one who be restless for action he lean on the windowsill he elbow spread he chin cup in he hand he indian blankness of countenance enliven by the glow of he eye as jewel enliven dull brown velvet firio i have something to tell you _ sí _ there be a labor of jack 's throat muscle and then he force out the truth in a few word firio he say this be my trail end i be go back to new york to-morrow _ sí _ answer firio without a tremor of emotion but he eye glow confidently fixedly into jack 's there will be money for you and -- _ sí _ say firio mechanically as if repeat the line of a lesson be this indian boy prepare for the news or do he not care be he simply clay that serve without feel the thought make jack wince he pause and the dark eye as in a spell keep stare into he and you get pd and wrath of god and jag ear and yes the big spur and the chap too to keep to remember I by firio do not answer you be not pleased you -- _ sí _ i will keep they for you you will want they you will come back to all this and suddenly firio be galvanized into the life of a single gesture he sweep he arm toward the sky indicate infinite distance no i shall never come back i can not jack say and he face have set hard as if it be a wall about to be drive at a wall i must go and i must stay _ sí _ say firio resume he impassiveness and slip around the corner of the house he do care jack cry with a smile which however be not the smile of garden of run brook and of song i be glad -- glad he pick up he crutch and go out to the three steed of trail memory : and _ you _ care -- _ you _ care he repeat to they he draw a lugubrious grimace in mockery at wrath of god he tickle the sliver of the donkey 's ear whereat jag ear wiggle the sliver in blissful unconsciousness that he have lose any of the ornamental equipment of he tribe you be like most of we we do not see we deformity jag ear jack tell he and if other be also blind to they why we should all be good-looking he arm slip around pd 's neck and he run a finger up and down pd 's nose with a tickle caress you old plodder he say you know a lot it be good to have the love of any living thing that have be near I as long as you have this preposterous being be preposterously sentimental over a pair of pony and a earless donkey when mr galway who have watch he from the window come out on the porch she see that he be on he way through the gate in the hedge to the street look here do the doctor say you might she call no my leg say it jack answer gaily just a little walk back soon it be he first enterprise in locomotion outside the limit of jim galway 's yard since he have be wound he turn blissful traveller again have come to know the face of the citizen now he be to look into the face of they habitation the broad main street with its row of tree narrow with perspective until it become a gray spot of desert sand under the tree leisurely flow those artery of ranch and garden-life the irrigation ditch continuity of line in the hedge-fence be evidently a municipal requirement but over the hedge individualism express itself freely yet with a harmony which have be set by public fashion the house be of cement in simple design they have no architectural message except that of a background for ornamentation by the genius of the soil 's productivity they wait on vine to cover they side and tree to cast shade across they doorway one need not remain long to know the old family in this community where the criterion of local aristocracy be the size of you plum or the number of crop of alfalfa you could grow in a year already jack feel at home it be as if he be friend with a whole world lack the social distinction which only begin when someone acquire sufficient worldly possession to give exclusive

the step feel that it be a formal occasion he search for the door-bell there be none he rap on the casing and wait while he look at the cool quiet interior with the portrait of david face he from the wall david you seem to be the only one at home he remark for there have be no answer to he rap and you be too busy get a bead on goliath to answer the immaterial question of a wayfarer accept the freedom of the little river custom on such occasion he follow the path to the rear he head knock off the dead petal of a rambler rise blossom scatter they at he foot round the corner of the house he see the arbor where he have dine the night of he arrival and beyond this a old-fashioned flower garden separate by a path from a garden of rose there be a sound of activity from the kitchen behind a trellis screen but he do not call out for guidance he would trust to find he own way when he come to the broad path its stretch lay under a crochet-work of shadow from the ragged leaf of two row of palm which run to the edge of a orange grove and the center of this path be in a straight line with the bottom of the v of galeria jasper ewold have lay out he little domain accord to a set plan before the water be first let go in laugh triumph over the parched earth and this plan as one might see on every hand be expressive of the training of older civilization in landscape gardening which age of man strive for harmonious form of beauty in green and grow thing have test and which the doge in all he unconventionalism of personality be as little inclined to amend as he be to amend the classic author a avenue of palm be the epic of the desert a bougainvillea vine its sonnet between the palm to the right and leave jack have glimpse of a vegetable garden of row of berry bush of a

bountiful sisterhood of petal of artificial cultivation speak of utility which must make the ground pay as well as please jack take each step as if he be apprehensive of disturb the quiet midway of the avenue of palm run a cross avenue and at the meeting-point be a circle which evidently wait till the orange and the olive should pay for a statue and surround bench over the breadth of the cross

tie and somehow he make even the overalls seem dressy pray sit down she say politely stand he crutch against the table he accept the invitation she resume she sewing eye on the needle lip press into a straight line and head bend low he might have be a stranger on a bench in a public park for all the attention she be pay to he she realize that she be rude and take satisfaction in it as the only way

as she stitch you wound be quite all right no danger of infection i do not blame you he burst out he tone have turn sad and urgent she look up quickly with the flare of a frown he remark have bring she out of she pose and she become vivid and real blame I she demand sharply as one who fly to arm but she meet a new phase -- neither banter nor fancy nor unvarying coolness in the face of fire he be all contrition and apology must she be the audience to some fresh exhibition of he versatility i do not blame you for feel the way that you do he say how do you know how i feel she ask and as far as he could see into she eye there be nothing but the flash of sword-point i do not i only know how i think you feel -- how you might well feel he answer delicately after pete let he gun drop in the

other quarrel have he know in he wanderings from colorado to chihuahua if you really want my opinion i be glad so far as i be concern that you do fight she say lightly be not you a hero be not the town free of leddy and you take the train in the morning yes the monosyllable be draw out rather faintly for the first time since they have meet on the pass she feel she be mistress of the situation this time she have not to plead with he in fear for he life she could regard he without any sense of obligation this invader of she garden retreat who have to put in one more afternoon in a dull desert town before he be away to that outside world which she might know only through book and memory she rise exultantly disregard any formality that she would owe to the average guest for a average guest he be not she attitude mean that she be have the last word that she be show she mettle he do not rise he be stare into the sunlight as if it be darkness alive with flit spectre which baffle identification yes back -- back to army of leddy he say slowly but this she see as still another pose it do not make she pause in gather up she sewing she be convince that there be nothing more for she to say except to give they parting a appearance of ease and unconcern be it work you mean you be not use to that i take it she inquire a little sarcastically yes call it work he answer look away from the spectre and back to she and you have never do any work she add not much he admit with he old airy carelessness he be smile at the spectre now as he have at the dinosaur as there be nothing particular about the garden that i can show you -- she be move away no i will be walk back to the house he say after she have take a few step will you wait on my slow pace he reach for he crutch lift himself to he foot and swing to she side she who wish that the interview be over saw that it must be prolonged then suddenly she realize the weakness as well as the brusqueness of she attitude she have be about to fly from he as from something that she fear it be not necessary it be foolish even cowardly i think perhaps you prefer to be alone you seem so abstracted she say lamely and then as they come out into the sunlight in the circle she begin talk of the garden as she would to any visitor of its beginning its growth and its future when she father 's plan should have be fulfil and in all these year you have never be back east he ask no we be always plan a trip but the money which we save for it go into more planting they have be move slowly toward the house but now he stop and he glance sweep the sky and rest on galerium it be the best valley of all i know it as soon as i see it from the pass and the rapture of the scene be sound in every syllable like chime out of the distance she know that he be far away from the garden and delaying still delay if she speak she feel that he would not hear what she say if she go on it seem certain that she would leave he stand there like a statue and there be more land here to make garden like this he ask slowly absorb yes with water and labor and time though he face be in the full light of the sun it seem at time in shadow then it glow as if between two passion for a instant it be grim the chin come forward the brow contract then it be transform with something that be as a complete surrender to the transport of irresistible temptation he look down at she quickly and she see he in the mood of story-telling to the child suffuse with the radiance of a decision i prefer the leddy of little river to the leddy of new york he say i be not go to-morrow i be go to have land and a home under the aegis of the eternal painter and in sight of galerium and worship at the shrine of fecund peace will you and the doge help I he ask with a enthusiasm that be infectious may i go to he school of agriculture horticulture and floriculture dumfounded she bent she head and stare at the ground to hide she astonishment you want citizen industrious young citizen do not you he persist yes yes she say hastily and confusedly do you know a good piece of land he continue yes several parcel she answer recover she poise and smile in mockery come on he cry he be take long jump step on he crutch as they go up the path you will take I to look at the land will not you please -- now i want to get acquaint with my future estate i mean to beat the smith at plum jim galway at alfalfa even rival bob worther at pumpkin and peony and you will help I lay out the flower garden will not you you see i shall have to call in the expert in every line to start with before i begin to improve on they and make they all jealous i may find a kind of plum that will grow on alfalfa stalk he hazard what a horticultural sensation and a spineless cactus call the leddy he eye be laugh into hers and hers irresistibly laugh back she guess that he be only joke he have act so well in the latest rôle that she have actually believe in he sincerity for a moment he mean to take the train of course but he resourceful capriciousness have supply he with a less awkward exit from the garden than she have provide he would yet have the last word if she do not watch out -- a last mischievous word at she expense first you will have to plow the ground in the broiling hot sun she say tauntingly when they have pass around to the porch she be start into the house with nervous precipitate triumph the last word be hers after all but you be go to show I the land now he tone be so serious and so hurt that she pause and -- with the seriousness electrify by a glance that seek for mutual understanding -- and we be to forget about that duel and the whole hero-desperado business i be a prospective settler who just arrive this afternoon i come direct to headquarters to inquire about property the doge not be at home will not you show I around again he have say the right thing at the right time with a delightful impersonality preclude sentiment i could not be unaccommodating she admit it be against all little river ethic i feel like a butterfly about to come out of he miserable chrysali have not you a walking-stick i be go to shed the crutch she become femininely solicitous at once be you sure you ought do the doctor say you might be the wound heal there be not any wound he answer that be one of the thing which we be to forget she bring a stick and he lay the crutch on the porch he favor the lame leg yet he keep up a clipping pace talk the while as fast as the doge himself as they pass through one of the side street out onto the cactus-spotted baking crack level this be it she say finally this be all that father and i have to begin with enough he answer and hold out he hand palm open with callouse i will win luxuriance she show he the irrigation ditch from which he should draw he water she tell he of the first step she paint all the difficulty in the darkest color without once lessen the glow of he optimism he be so overwhelmingly boyishly happy that she have to be happy with he in make believe that he be about to be a real rancher but he should not have the sport all on he side he must not think that she accept this latest departure of he imagination incarnate by he thespian gift in anything but he own spirit you plow you spray tree for the scale you digging up weed you stack alfalfa you settle down in one place as a unit of co-ordinate industry you earn bread by the sweat of you brow you with callouse thus she laugh at he very seriously he hold out he hand and run a finger around a palm and across the finger-joint : that be where i shall get they he say but not on the thumb i believe you get they on the thumb only by play golf he ask about carpenter and laborer he choose the site for he house he plot the walk and orchard she could not refuse she advice who can about the planning of new house and garden he have everything quite settle except the land grant from the doge when they start back while the sun with the swift passage of time in such fascinating diversion have swing low in its ellipse when they reach the main street the doge be on the porch pass he opinion on the eternal painter 's evening work some very remarkable purple to-night i admit you majesty without any intention of give you too good a opinion of yourself but otherwise you be not up to you mark there must have be a downpour in the rainy world on the other side of the sierra that moisten you pigment next thing we know you will be turn water-colorist he be say when he hear jack 's voice here be a new settler jack call i be go to stay in little river and win all the prize you be joke gasp the doge not joke say jack i want to close the bargain to-night you bring color and adventure -- yes i do not expect the honor -- the town will be delighted i be overwhelm will you plow with pete leddy 's gun draw by wrath of god sir and harrow with you spur draw by jag ear shall you make a specialty of olive do you dare to aspire as high as date the doge 's speech have begin incoherently but steady into rally humor at the close i have not see the date-tree yet say jack not until i have can i judge whether or not i shall dare to rival the lord of the manor in he own specialty and there be business detail which i must settle with you o doge of this city of slender canal o youth will you tarry with peace between war answer the doge in quick response to the spirit of nonsense as a basis for they new relation come and i will show you we noblest product of peace the date-tree wonderful he say lead the way to the garden while mary hurry rather precipitately into the house jasper ewold be at he best a glowing husbandman when he point aloft to the cluster of fruit pendent from the crotch of the stiff branch enclose in cloth bag to keep they free of insect do you see strange letter on the cloth he ask yes it look like arabic so it be among other futile diversion in a past incarnation i study arabic a little and i still have my lexicon perhaps my construction might not please the grammarian of classic bagdad but the sentiment be there safe enough in the language of the mother romance world of the date : ` all hail first-born of we western desert fecundity ' it be call out to the pass and the range from the waste where the sagebrush have have its own way since the great stir that there be in the world at genesis with the unlimited authority i have in bestow title say jack i have a mind to make you a emir but it be a pity that you have not a camel squat under you date-tree and placidly chew he cud a tempting thought declare the doge unctuously bob worther could ride he on the tour of inspection i think the jounce would be almost as good a flesh-reducer as pedestrianism there you go you would have the camel wear bell with rein of red leather and a purple saddle-cloth hang with spangle and bob -- we excellent bob -- in a turban persiflage sir a very demoralization of the faculty with cataract of verbiage sir declare the doge as he start back to the house little river be a practical town he proceed seriously we indulge in nonsense only after sunset and when a stranger appear ride a horse with a profane name yes a practical town and i be surprise at you disloyalty to you own burro by mention camel it rest with you i believe to let I have the land and also the water say jack we grow businesslike return the doge with a change of manner very declare jack the requirement be that you become a member of the water user ' association and pay you quota of tax per acre foot and the price you pay for you land also go to the association but i decide on the eligibility of the applicant they be in front of the house by this time and again the doge give jack that sharp quick know glance of scrutiny through he heavy tufted eyebrow before he proceed : the concession for the use of the river for irrigation be mine administer by the water user ' association as if it be theirs under the condition that no one who have not my approval can have membership that be it be practically mine owe to my arrangement with old mr leffert who live upstream he be a eccentric a hermit he come here many year ago to get as far away from civilization as he could i judge that give he a underlie right originally he have two partner squaw man both be dead he have make no improvement beyond draw enough water for a garden and for he horse and cow when i come to make a bargain with he he name a annual sum which should keep he for the rest of he life and thus he waive he rights first jim galway then other settler drift in i form the water user ' association all tax and sum for the sale of land go into keep the dam and ditch in condition you take nothing for yourself a great deal the work out of a idea -- a idea in mould a little community in my old age in a fashion that please I while my own property of course increase in value at my death the rights go to the community but no utopia sir chap just hard-working cheerful man and woman in a safe refuge and i be young exclaimed jack with a hopeful smile i have good health i mean to work i try to be cheerful be i eligible sir chap you -- you have do we a great favor everybody like you sir chap -- the doge hesitate for a instant with a baffling unspoken inquiry in he eye -- sir chap i like you companionship and you mastery of persiflage jim galway who be secretary of the association will look after detail of the permit and bob worther will turn the water on you land and the whole town will assist you with advice luck sir chap in you new vocation that evening while the doge take down the david and set a fragment from the frieze of the parthenon in its place little river talk of the delightful news that it be not to lose its strange story-teller and duelist little river be puzzle not once have jack intimate a thought of stay by he own account so far as he have give any he wound have merely delay he departure to new york where he have press business he have he reservation on the pullman make for the morning express he have pay a farewell call at the ewold and apparently then have change he mind and he career these be the only clue to work on except the one suggest by mr galway who be the wise woman of the community while mr smith be the propagandist i guess he like the way mary ewold snub he say mr galway but there be one person in town who be not surprise at jack 's decision when jack sing out as he enter the galway yard on return from the doge 's we stay firio we stay firio say : _ sí _ señor jack with no change of expression except a brighter gleam than usual in he velvety eye xv when the desert bloom perhaps we may best describe this as a chapter of incident or to use a simile a broad eddy bend in a river on a plateau with cataract and canyon await it on its route to the sea or discard the simile and speaking in literal term in a search for a theme on which to hang the incident we revert to mary 's raillery at the announcement of a easy traveller that he be go to turn sober rancher you plow you blister you hand you earn you bread by the sweat of you brow but there he be in blue overalls sink he spade deep for setting digging ditch and drive furrow through the virgin soil while the mason and carpenter build he ranch house they be straight furrow too jack declare passably so answer mary and look at the blister he continue exhibit he puffy palm you seem to think blister a remarkable human phenomenon a sensational novelty to a labor population now would you advise prick he ask with deference to she judgment it be so critical in you case that you ought to consult a doctor rather than take lay advice jim galway say that the thorough way i mulched my soil before put in my first crop of alfalfa be a model for all future settler he venture she remark that jim be always encourage to new-comer and remark this in a way that imply that some new-comer possibly need hazing and i be up at dawn and hard at it for six hour before midday yes it be wonderful she admit with a mock show of be overwhelmingly impressed nobody in the world ever work ten hour a day before i be do more than any man that i pay two-fifty i do perspire and if you do not call that earn you bread with the sweat of you brow why this be a astoundingly illogical world there be a great difference between sporadic display and that continuity which be the final proof of efficiency she correct he long involve sentence often indicate the loss of a argument declare jack there be not any argument say mary with superior disinterestedness by common inspiration they have establish a truce of nonsense she still call he jack he still call she mary it be the only point of tacit admission that they have ever meet before he ask she to show a prospective settler a parcel of land they new relation be as the house of card of fellowship : card of glass iridescent and brittle mock the idea that there could be oblivion of the scene in lang 's store the crack of leddy 's pistol in the _ arroyo _ or the pulse of jack 's artery under she thumb she be sure that he could forget these experience even if she could not that be he character as she see it free of clinging root of yesterday 's event live some new part every day in the house of card she set up a barrier which he see as a veil over she eye not once have he a glimpse of they depths there be only the surface gleam of sunbeam and sometimes of rapier-point merry but significant she frequently ride out to the pass and occasionally when he day 's work be do he would ride to the foot of the range to meet she and as they come back he often sing but never whistle indeed he have cease to whistle altogether perhaps he regard the omission as a insurance against duel aside from nonsense they have common interest in cultural and daily life from the eternal painter 's brushwork to how to dress a salad she do extend she approval for the generous space which he be allow for flower-bed and advise he in the practical construction of he kitchen while the doge decorate the living-room with delium robbia which however never arrive at the express office he be a neighbor always at home in the ewold house the doge revel in they disputation yet never be really intimate or affectionate as he be with jim galway who know not the pittus the prado nor the louvre and could not understand the intone of dante in the original as jack could thanks to he have be bring up in library and gallery the town which be not suppose to ask about past could not help puzzling about he what be the story of this teller of story the secluded little community be in a poor way to find out even if the conscientious feeling about a custom have not be a restraint that keep wonder free from inquire hint they take he for what he be in all they personal relation that be the delightful way of little river which inner curiosity might not alloy he broader experience of that world over the pass which stretch around the globe and back to the other range-wall of the valley seem only to make he fall more easily into the simple way of the fellow-rancher of the doge 's selection who be genuine hall-marked people whatever the origin from which the individual spring he know the fatigue of productive labor as something far sweeter than the fatigue that come from mere exercise and the neophyte 's enthusiasm be he i be sit at the outer edge of the circle he tell jim galway but when my first crop be harvest i shall be on the inside -- a real rancher you have already get one foot over the circle say jim and with my first crop of date i 'll be in the holy of holy of pastoral bliss yes i should say so jim respond but in a way that indicate surprise at the thought of jack 's remain in little river long enough for such a consummation when he alfalfa cover the earth with a green carpet jack be under a spell of something more than the never-ending marvel of dry seed spring into succulent abundance without the wave of any magic wand i make it out of the desert he cry it laugh in triumph at the bare stretch around it wait on water that be it say jim wait on water the promise of what might come it will come some day jack you and i will ride up into the river canyon and i will show you a place where you can see the blue sky between precipitous wall two hundred foot high the abyss be so narrow you can throw a stone across it what lie beyond ask jack he eye light vividly a great basin which be the bed of a ancient lake before the water wear its way through a dam between those wall -- and you have another lake yes and the spring freshet from the northern water-shed all hold in a reservoir -- none go to waste and jack as population spread the dam must come why the doge have a kingdom yes that be the best of it the rights be in he hand he share up with everybody and we get it when he die that be why we be ready to accept the doge 's sentiment as kind of gospel if ornamental hedge waste water and bring bug and be contrary to practical ranching idea why -- well why not it be we little river to enjoy as we please we be not grow so fast but we be grow in a clean beautiful way as jasper ewold say what if that river be own by one man what if we have to pay the price he set for what take the place of rain as they do in some place in californium we be go to say who shall build that dam think of it think of it jack half whisper he imagination in play plot after plot be add to this little oasis until it extend from range to range one sea of green many little town with little river the mother town spread its idea yes think of be in at the making of a new world see vision develop into reality as stone by stone a edifice rise i -- i -- jack pause a cloud sweep over he feature he eye seem to stare at a wall he body alone seem in little river he mind on the other side of the pass he be in one of those mood of abstraction that ever make he fellow-rancher feel that he would not be with they permanently indeed he have whole day when he smile have a sad turn when though he speak pleasantly the inspiration of talk be not in he and when belvy smith could not rouse any action in the cat with two black stripe down its back but many little riversite include the doge have they sad day when they look away at the pass oftener than usual as if see a life-story frame in the v he come usually as mr smith observe when he have a letter from the east and it be then that he would pretend to cough to firio these mock cough spell be one of the few manifestation that make the impassive firio laugh now you know i be not well do not you firio he would ask waggishly the very think seem to take he out of the doldrums i could never live out of this climate why even now i have a cough kuh-er firio have turn a stove cook he accept the humiliation in a spirit of loyalty but often he would go out among the sagebrush and return with a feathery tribute which he would broil on a spit in a fire make in the yard always when jack ride out to meet mary at the foot of the range firio would follow and always he have he rifle for it be part of jack 's seeming inconsistency emphasize he inscrutability that he would never wear he revolver it hang beside pete 's on the wall of the living-room as a second relic far from be a quarrel-maker he be peaceful to the point of quakerish predilection nobody ever hear anything of leddy say jim but he will never forget or forgive and one day he will show up unexpectedly not arm say jack do you think he will keep he word i know he will i ask he and he say he would you be very simple jack but mind he can keep he word and still use a gun outside the town so he might admit jack laughing in a way that indicate that the subject be distasteful to he for he would never talk of the duel now we come to that little affair of pedro nogale pedro be a half-breed whose god among man be pete leddy no less than jack be firio 's and the doge be ignacio 's in he shanty back of bill lang 's the mexican and indian lose they remain wages in gamble after he have fill they with _ mescal _ it happen that gonzalez head man of the laborer under bob worther who have save quite a sum come away penniless after take but one drink every ounce of bob 's avoirdupois be in a rage it be time we clean out pedro 's place seh he tell jack and you and jim galway have get to help I do it i do not like to get into a row say jack very soberly then i 'll undertake the job alone bob retorted that will be a good deal worse for when i get go i lose my temper and i tell you seh i have get a lot to lose and jack be you go to stand by and see robbery do by the meanest most worthless greaser in the valley -- and a good indian the victim yes jack say jim you have get such a formidable reputation since you set-to with leddy that the indian think you be a regular master of magic you be just the one to make pedro come to term a formidable reputation without firing a shot admit jack quizzically and consent you 'll surely want you gun this time bob warn he no say jack but -- i have hang up my gun jack say decisively we 'll try to handle this peacefully come on well we have get we gun anyway jim put in it be mid-afternoon a slack hour for pedro 's kind of trade and the shanty be empty of customer when the impromptu vigilance committee enter pedro himself be half doze in the faro dealer 's chair he small ferret eye flash a spark at the visitor as he rise but he be politeness itself señores it be great honor be seat señores he say with eloquent deference the very sight of he set all the ounce in bob quivering in a outburst : no chair for we you fork over gonzalez 's money that you trick out of he i take gonzalez 's money i señores it be a hundred and twenty dollar that he earn honestly and the quicker you lay you hand on it the better for you bob roared back pedro be quite impassive señores if gonzalez need money -- señores i honest man señores sit down we talk pedro drop back into he chair and he hand with cat-like quickness shot under the faro table jack have come through the door after jim and bob he be stand a little behind they and while they have be watch pedro 's face he have watch pedro 's movement pedro take you hand out from under the table and without you gun say jack and jim galway catch a thrill in jack 's voice that he have hear in the _ arroyo _ pedro look into señor do not care 's eye and see a bead though they be not look along the glint of a revolver barrel _ sí _ señor say pedro settle back in the chair with palm out in intimation of he pacific intention now pedro you have gonzalez 's money have not you jack go on in the reasoning fashion that he have adopt to leddy in the store and you be not go to make yourself or bob trouble you be go to give it back _ sí _ señor say pedro wince while he be produce the money and count it he furtive glance keep watch of jack then as the committee turn to go he suddenly exclaim with angry surprise and disillusion : you get no gun while jim and bob wait for jack to precede they out of the door jim have time to note pedro 's baleful piercing look at jack 's back just as i tell you jack -- and i reckon you save a big row you just put a scare into that hellion with a word like you have a thousand devil in you say jim it be all over jack answer look more hurt than pleased over the congratulation very fortunately over but jim observe tensely pedro be not only leddy 's bitter partisan and ready to do he bidding pedro 's a bit loco besides -- the kind that hesitate at nothing when he get a grudge you have get to look out for he oh no say jack in the full swing of a señor do not care mood jim and bob begin to entertain the feeling of mary on the pass when she think of jack as walk over precipice regardless of danger sign after all do he really know how to shoot if he would not look after himself it be they duty to look after he jim suggest that the rule which jack have make for leddy should have universal application no one whosoever should wear arm in little river without a permit the new ordinance have the doge 's approval and jim and bob both of whom have permit keep watch that it be enforce particularly in the case of pedro nogale meanwhile jack keep the ten-hour-a-day law he alfalfa be grow with prolific rapidity but firio have the air of one who wait between journey never the trail again he ask temptingly one day never the trail again jack declare firmly _ sí sí sí _ -- the trail again you think so then why do you ask to make a question answer firio the big sadness will be too strong it will make you move -- _ sí _ the big sadness jack exclaim he seize firio by the shoulder and look narrowly at he and firio meet the gaze with soft puzzling light in he eye ho ho a big sadness how do you know he laugh i learn on the trail when i watch you look at the star and señorita ewold she know but she think the big sadness a devil she -- and he pause she -- yes jack ask she -- firio start again jack suddenly raise he hand from firio 's shoulder in a gesture of interruption it be not exactly firio 's place to hazard opinion about mary ewold never mind he say rather sharply but firio proceed fixedly to finish what he have to say she have a big sadness which make she ride to the pass she ride out so she can ride back smile firio do not mistake you imagination for divination jack warn he as firio do not understand the meaning of this he say nothing probably he would have say nothing even if he have understand i 'll show you the nature of the big sadness and that the devil be a joy devil when we harvest we first crop of alfalfa jack conclude then i shall make a holiday then i shall be a real rancher and something be go to happen the trail exclaim firio and the soft light in he eye flash _ sí _ the trail and the big spur and the revolver in the holster no but firio say _ sí _ with the supreme confidence of one who hold that belief in fulfilment will make any wish come true xvi a change of mind it be Sunday afternoon or to date it by a epochal event the day after jack 's alfalfa crop have fall before the mower mary be seat on the bench under the avenue of umbrella-trees read a thin edition of marcus aurelius bind in flexible leather of late she have develop a fondness for the more austere philosopher jack whose mood be entirely to the sonneteer come softly sing down the avenue of palm and present himself before she in a romp spirit of interruption o expert in floriculture he say the humble pupil act as a committee of one have fail utterly to agree with himself as to the form of he new flowerb there must be a committee of two will you come good i be weary of marcus i can not help think that he too far antedate the bordeaux mixture she answer spring to she foot with positive enthusiasm he rarely meet positive enthusiasm in she and everything in he call for it at the moment he find it so inspiring that the problem of the bed be settle easily by he consent to all she suggestion -- a too-ready consent she tell herself after all it be you flower garden she remind he no every flower garden in little river be yours he declare the way he say this make she frown she see he take a step on the other side of that barrier over which she mount guard never make you hyperbole felonious she warn he besides if you be go to be a real little riversite you should have opinion of you own i have not any to-day -- none except victory and he hold out he palm exhibit they yellowish plate look even corn on the joint yes they look quite real she admit censoriously have not i make good do you remember how you stand here on the very site of my house and lecture I i would not work i would not -- you have work a little -- a little she say grudgingly and show he as much of the wondrous sparkle in she eye as he could see out of the corner between the lash she never allow he to look into she eye if she apprehend any attempt to cross the barrier but she could see well enough out of the corner to know that he glance have a kind of hungry joy and a promise of some new demonstration in he attitude toward she she must watch that barrier very shrewdly look at my hedge he go on it be knee-high already and my umbrella-tree cast enough shade for anybody if he will wrap himself around the trunk but such thing be ornamental i have a more practical appeal come on he elation be insistent superior to any prickle gibe of banter as they walk on the mealy earth between row of young orange setting and the sweet odor of dry alfalfa come to they nostril bear by a vagrant breeze he sweep he hand toward the field in a gesture of pride he shoulder throw back in a deep breath of exultation the callouse win and he exhibit they again but she refuse even to glance at they this time you seem to think callouse phenomenal most people in little river accept they as they do the nose on they face they certainly be phenomenal on I so be my first crop my first crop i 'll be up at dawn to stack it -- and then i be no longer a neophyte i be a initiate i be a real rancher a holiday be due i celebrate he be rhapsodic and he be serious too she be provokingly flippant as a antidote for marcus aurelius whom she be still carry in the little flexible leather volume how celebrate she inquire by walk through the town with a wisp of alfalfa in one hand and exhibit the callouse on the other or will you be draw on a float by jag ear -- a float label ` the idler enjoy he own reform ' we 'll all turn out and cheer amusing but not dignified and not to my taste no i shall celebrate by a terrific spree -- a ride to the pass he turn he face toward the range earnest in its transfixion and suffuse with the spirit of restlessness and the call of the mighty rock mass gray in they great rib and purple in they abyss she feel that same call as something fluid and electric run through the air from sky to earth and set she lip in readiness for whatever folly he be about to suggest a ride to the pass and a view of the sunset from the very top he cry he look down at she quickly and all the force of the call he have transform into a sunny personal appeal which make she avert she glance my day in the country -- my holiday if you will go with I will you and gaze out over that spot of green in the glare of the desert know that a little of it be mine you orange-tree be too young it be so far away they will hardly show she venture survey the distance to the pass judicially will you why to I a ride to the pass be not a thing to be plan a day beforehand she say deliberately still studiously observe galerium it be a matter of momentary inspiration make it a set engagement and it be but a plodding journey i can best tell in the morning she conclude and by the way i see you have not yet try graft plum on the alfalfa stalk no i have learn better it be not consistent you see you mow alfalfa and you pick plum this return to drollery in keep with the prescribe order of they relation make she look up in candid amusement over the barrier which for a moment he have be endanger honestly jack you do improve she say with mock encouragement you seem to have master a number of the simple truth of age-old agricultural experience but will you will you ride to the pass he have the question launch fairly into she eye she could not escape it he see one bright flash whether of real anger or simply vexation at he reversion to the theme he could not tell and she lash drop she run the leaf edge of the austere marcus back and forth in she finger thip-thip-thip that be the only sound for some seconds very long seconds as i have already try to make clear to you it be such a businesslike thing to ride to the pass unless you have the inspiration she remark thoughtfully to marcus perhaps i shall get the inspiration on the way back to the house which be a signal that she be go and by the way jack to return to the object of my come if you have idea of you own about flower incorporate they that be the way to develop you floricultural talent she turn away but he follow he be at she side and proceeding with she he head bent toward she boyishly eagerly you see i have never be out to the pass he remark urgently what you -- she start in surprise and check herself do not i come by train he ask reprovingly no she answer she eye be level with the road she voice be a little unnatural no you come over the pass jack it be the first time in the month of he citizenship of little river that she have ever hint anything but belief in the fiction that they have first meet when he ask she to show he a parcel of land she seem to be call a truth out of the past and grapple with it while she lip tighten and she draw in she chin then i do come over the pass he agree and after a pause add : but there be no pete leddy yes oh yes -- there be a pete leddy but he will not be there this time and now he voice in a transport that seem to touch the cloud height be neither like the voice of the easy traveller on the pass nor the voice of he sharp call to leddy to disarm nor the voice of the storyteller it have a new note a note startling to she we shall be on the pass without leddy and smile over leddy and thank he for he unwitting service in make I stop in little river he conclude yes he do that she admit stoically as if it be some oppressive fact for which she could offer no thanks i want to see we pony with they bridle hang loose i want the great silence i want company with imagination speaking from the sky and reality speaking from the patch of green out on the sea of gray will you they step run rhythmically together he look be eager in anticipation while she keep on run the leaf of the austere marcus through she finger she lip be half open as if about to speak but be without word the thin delicate nostril tremble will you will you because i keep the faith of callouse will you go forth and dream for a day we 'll tell fairy story we 'll get a pole and prod the dinosaur through the narrow part of the pass and hear he roar he awfullest will you she finger pause in the page as if they have find a helpful passage the chin tilted upward resolutely and he have a full view of she eye dance with challenging light she be augustly gloriously mischievous will you go in costume will you wear you spur and the chap and the silk shirt the question say that it be not a time to be serious it sprinkle the crest of the barrier with gleam sliver of glass which might give zest to word speak across it but would be most sharp to the touch i will wear my spur around my wrist if you say tie rose in the fringe of my chap bind my hat with a big red silk bandanna and put streamer on pd 's bit that be too entice for refusal she answer playfully i particularly want to hear the dinosaur roar they have come to the opening of the ewold hedge and they pause to consider arrangement there be no one in sight on the street except jim galway who be approach at some distance shall we start in the morning and have luncheon at the foot of the range suggest jack she favor a early afternoon start he argue for he point of view and in they preoccupation with the passage of arm they do not notice pedro nogale slip along beside the hedge with soft step he hand under he jacket a gleam out of the bosom of pedro 's jacket a cry from mary and a knife flash upward and drive toward jack 's neck jack have seem oblivious of he surroundings he gaze center on mary yet he be able to duck backward so that the blade only slit open he shirt as pedro with the misdirected force of he blow lunge past its object mary see that face which have be laugh into hers which have be so close to hers in its persistent smile of persuasion strike white and rigid and a glint like that of the blade itself in the eye in a breath jack have become another being of incarnate unthinking physical power and swiftness one hand seize pedro 's wrist the other he upper arm and mary hear the metallic click of the knife as it strike the earth and the sickening sound of the bone of pedro 's forearm crack she see pedro 's eye burst from they socket in pain and fear she see jack 's still profile of unyielding will and the set muscle of he neck and the knit muscle of he forearm drive pedro over against the hedge as if bent on break the mexican 's back in two and she wait in frozen apprehension to hear another bone crack even expect pedro 's death cry the devil be out of señor do not care it be the voice of ignacio who have come around the house in time to witness the scene what fearful strength you will kill he it be the voice of the doge from the porch yes please stop mary plead suddenly at the sound of she cry jack release he hold the strong column of he neck become apparently too weak to hold the weight of he head inert he fall against the hedge for support he hand hang limp at he side while he stare dazedly into space it seem then that pedro might have pick up the knife and carry out he plan of murder without defense by the victim yes yes yes jack repeat pedro have not move from the hollow in the hedge which the impress of he body have make he be tremble he lip have fall away from he tooth and he watch jack in stricken horror a beaten creature wait on some judgment from which there be no appeal we 'll tell fairy story -- jack 's soft tone of persuasion repeat themselves in mary 's ear in contrast to the effect of what she have just witness she hand slip along the crest of the hedge as if to steady herself i 'll change my mind about go to the pass jack she say yes mary he answer in a faint tone he look around to see she back as she turn away from he then with a effort he step free of the hedge come we will go to the doctor he say to the mexican he touch pedro 's shoulder softly and softly run he hand down the sleeve in which the arm hang limp pedro have not move he still lean against the hedge inanimate as a mannikin come you leg be not break you can walk say jim galway who have come up in a hurry when he see what be happen pedro you will learn not to play with the devil in señor do not care whisper ignacio while mary have disappear in the house and the doge stand watch jack have stroke pedro 's head while the bone be be set he have arrange for pedro 's care and now he be in he own yard with jag ear and the pony rub they muzzle alternately in silent impartiality he head bow reflectively as firio come around the corner of the house at first he half stare at firio then he survey the steed of he long journeying in question uncertainty and then look back at firio smile wanly firio he say i feel that i be a pretty big coward firio i be full up -- full to overflow my mind be stuff with cobweb i -- i must think thing out i must have the solitude the trail prescribe doctor firio after jack have give he ranch in charge to galway he ride away in the dusk not by the main street but straight across the level toward the pass xvii the doge snap a rubber band jasper ewold be a disciple of a old-fashioned custom that have fall into disuse since the multiplicity of typewriter make write for one 's own pleasure too arduous or if you will have another reason since we existence and feeling have become so complex that we can no longer express they with the simple directness of we ancestor he keep a diary with what he call a perfect regularity of intermittency a week might pass without he write a single word and again he might indulge freely for a dozen night run he write as much or as little as he please he write when he have something to tell and when he be in the mood to tell it it be face yourself in you own ink he say it be confess that you be a egoist and provide a antidote for you egoism firstly you will never be bore by you own past if you can appreciate you error and inconsistency secondly you will never be tempt to bear other with you past as long as you wish to pose as a wise man he must have find as you would find if you have leave youth behind and could see yourself in you own ink that the first tracery of any controlling factor in you life be faint and inconsequential to you at the time without presage of its importance until you see other line also faint and inconsequential in they beginning draw in toward it to form a powerful current on the evening that jack take to the trail again jasper ewold have a number of thick notebook out of the box in the library which he always keep lock and place they on the living-room table beside he easy chair in which he settle himself mary be sew while he pore over he life in review as write by he own hand she knowledge of the secret of that chronicle from wander student day to desert exile be limit to glimpse of the close line of fine-written page across the breadth of the circle of the lamp 's reflection he surround he diary with a line of mystery which she never attempt to cross on occasion he would read to she certain portion which strike he recollection happily but these be invariably limit to he impression of some city or some work of art that he be see for the first time in the geniality of the unadulterated joy of living in what she guess be the period of youth before she be bear and never do they throw any light on he story except that of he view as a traveller and a personality but he do not break out into a single quotation to-night it seem as if he be follow the thread of some reference from year to year for he run he finger through the leaf of certain part hastily and become studiously intense at other part as he gloomily ponder over they neither she nor she father have mention jack since the scene by the hedge this be entirely in keep with custom it seem a matter of instinct with both that they never talk to each other of he yet she be conscious that he have be in she father 's mind all through the evening meal and she be equally certain that she father realize that he be in she mind it be late when the doge finish he reading and he finish it with the page of the last book where the fine handwriting stop at the edge of the blank white space of the future a old desire ever strong with mary which she have never quite have the temerity to express have become impel under the influence of she father 's unusually long and silent preoccupation be i never to have a glimpse of that treasure be i never never to read you diary she ask the doge draw he tufted eyebrow together in utter astonishment what what mary why mary i might preach a lesson on the folly of feminine curiosity do you think i would ask to see you diary but i do not keep one hoo-hoo-hoo the doge be blow out he lip in a ado of deprecatory nonsense do not keep one have you lose you memory i have it a minute ago -- yes after a instant 's playful consideration i be sure that i have it now then everybody with a memory certainly keep a diary would you want I to read all the foolish thing you have ever think do you think i would want to no she answer there you be then declare the doge victoriously as he rise slip a rubber band with a forbid snap over the last book and this be all stupid personal stuff -- but mine own there be a unconscious sigh of weariness as he take up the thumb leather volume he be haggard mine own have give he no pleasure that evening all the year of he life seem to rest heavily upon he for a silent moment mary fear that she have hurt he by she request you have read so much you will scarcely do any write to-night she venture yes i will add a few more line -- the spirit be in I -- a few more day to the long record he say absently then after a pause suddenly with a kind of suppress force vibrate in he voice : well we sir chap have go as unceremoniously as he come she answer it be terrible the way he break nogale 's wrist remark the doge narrowly terrible she assent as she fold she work she head bent go and doubtless for good he continue still watch she sharply very likely she answer carelessly without look up he vagarious playtime for this section be over just it just it the doge exclaim happily and if leddy overtake he now it be he own affair yes yes he and he wrath of god and jag ear be away to other world and other leddy no doubt no doubt conclude the doge in high good humor all the vexation of he diary seemingly forget as he leave the room but as the doge and mary be to find they be alone among little riversite in think that the breaking of pedro nogale 's wrist be horrible jim galway who have witness the affair take a radically contrary view which everyone else not of the leddy partisanship readily accept despite the frequency of jack 's visit to the ewold garden and all the happy exchange of pleasantry with he host the community could not escape the thought of a certain latent hostility toward jack on the part of the doge the more noticeable because it be so out of keep with he nature doge sometimes i think you be almost prejudice against jack wingfield because he do not let leddy have he way say jim with a outright frankness that be unprecedented in speak to jasper ewold you be such a regular old quaker but that little mexican panting in abject fear against the hedge persist the doge a nice peaceful little mexican with a knife sneak up to plant it in jack 's neck but jack be so powerful and he look i be so near i could see it well as he tower over nogale yes no mistake the look i see it in the _ arroyo _ it make I think of what the look of one of those old sea-fighter might have be like when they lash alongside and board the enemy and the crack of the bone continue the doge would you have a man turn cherub when he have escape have he jugular slash by a margin of two or three inch would you have he say ` please naughty boy give I you knife you must not play with such thing ' no that be hyperbole the doge return with a lame attempt at a laugh mebbe it be whatever hyperbole be say jim but if so hyperbole be a darned poor means of self-defence yes the trouble be you be against jack wingfield yes i be say the doge suddenly as if inward anger have get the better of he and the rest of we be for he jim declare sturdily naturally naturally say the doge pass he hand over he brow yes youth and color and bravery he shake he head moodily as if jim 's statement bring up some vital unpleasant but inevitable fact to he mind it be beyond I how anybody can help like he conclude galway stubbornly i like he -- yes i do like he i can not help it the doge admit rather grudgingly as he turn away so we be not so far apart after all galway hasten to call after the doge in apology for he testiness we like he for what he have be to we and will always be to we that be the only criterion of character in little river accord to you own code be not it jasper ewold exactly answer the doge over he shoulder the community enter into a committee of the whole on jack wingfield with every citizen contribute a quota of personal experience he story be rehearse from the day of he arrival to the day of he departure argument fluctuate on the question of whether or not he would ever return with now the no and now the aye have it on this point jim have the only first-hand evidence he say to let thing grow until he show up or i hear from he say jim not what i would call enlighten say bob worther that be he way of express it but to do he justice he show what a good rancher he be by he attention to the detail that have to be care for jim add he be like the spirit of the wind i guess put in mr galway something come a-calling he or a-driving he i do not know which indeed i be not altogether certain that it be not a case of mary ewold this time yes agree jim the fight look go out of he face when she speak and when he see how horrify she be why i never see such a change come over a man it be just like a piece of steel wilting however the child who have no part in the August discussion of the committee of the whole be certain that they story-teller would come back they idea about jack be base on a simple self-convincing faith of the same order as firio 's lonely as they be they be hardly more lonely than they elder who be suppose to have the philosophy of adult no jack singing out hello on the main street no jack look up from work to ask boyishly : be i learn oh i 'll be the boss rancher yet no jack spring all sort of conceit not of broad humor but the kind that sort of set a twinkle in you inside as bob worther express it no jack inspiring a feeling deeper than twinkle on he sad day he have be a improvement in town life that become indispensable once it be absent little river be fairly homesick for he how do we ever get along without he before he come anyway bob worther demand then another new-comer as distinctive from the average settler as jack be divert talk into another channel without however reconcile the people to they loss xviii another stranger arrive if the history of little river be to be write in chapter heading the first would be jasper ewold found the town the second jack wingfield arrive and the third john prather arrive while jack come in chap and spur bear a argosy of fancy prather come by rail carry a suitcase in a conventional and businesslike fashion bill deer as the representative of a spring wagon that do the local omnibus and express business be on the platform of the station when the 11:15 roll in and sing out in a burst of joy as the stranger a man in the early twenty step off the pullman : what be this jack back by train -- and in store clothes well of all -- and see he mistake when the stranger 's full face be turn toward he yes i be sometimes call jack say the stranger pleasantly now where have we meet before perhaps in goldfield no matter it be time we get acquaint my name be prather and yours as he survey the man before he bill be as fuss as the giant of the fairy story have be by a display of yellow he be uncertain whether he be give he own baptismal name or somebody 's else by jing no i do not know you but you sure be the dead spit of a fellow i do know say bill well he have do I the favor of introduce I to you anyway say prather who have a remarkably ingratiating smile i would like a place to stop while i take a look around be there a hotel room over the store and grub at mr smith 's -- none better that will do as they ride into town more than one passer-by call out a ringing hello jack or back eh jack hurrah for you and then utter a exclamation of disillusion when prather turn he head the other see it too say bill they seem to who be this double of mine jack wingfield jack wingfield it seem that we first name be the same too he live here i take it yes but he be away now well when he come back -- with a pause of slight irritation -- there will be no difficulty in tell we apart he put he finger to a triangular patch of mole on he cheek he irritation pass and a sense of appreciative amusement at the distinction take its place now where shall i find jasper ewold he ask as bill draw up before the smith a few minute later the doge busy among he orange-tree hear a step look up with a signal of recognition which change to blank inquiry when the cheek with the mole be turn toward he upon my word sir i -- i think that you be -- he begin mr wingfield yes everybody in town seem to think so at first glance so i be quite use to the comparison by this time prather put in easily it be very interesting to meet the founder of a town and i have come to you to find out about condition here prather do not appear as if he have ever do manual labor he be too young to have turn from ill health or failure in the city to the refuge of the land indeed he quiet gray suit of good material indicate unostentatious prosperity evidently he be well-bred and evidently he be not a agent for a new style of seed harrow or weed killer you think of settle ask the doge yes from all i have hear of little river it be a community where i should feel at home then sir we will talk of it at luncheon it be knocking-off time for the morning yes i 'll talk as much as you please come on mr prather they start along the avenue of palm the doge still study the face at he side pardon I for stare at you but the resemblance to jack wingfield at first sight be most striking he add have he travel much in the west ask prather yes much -- lead a aimless life then he must be the one that i be take for in salt lake city one day the man who call out to I see he mistake just as you do when he see my full face and again prather make a gesture of understand amusement to the mole when you consider what confusion there must be in the workroom with the stork flap and screech like newsboy outside the delivery room muse the doge and when you consider the multitudinous population of the earth it be surprising that the good lord be able to furnish such a variety of face as he do but they do say that every one of we have a few double in the case of famous public man they get they picture in the papers yes very few of we but have be mistake for a friend by a stranger pass in the street prather suggest only to have the stranger see he mistake at a second glance and on second glance you do not look very much like jack wingfield the doge conclude just a coincidence in physiognomy and prather be very frank about he past i have lead rather a hard life he say though i be well bring up my father leave mother and I quite penniless i have to fend for myself at the age of sixteen a friend give I a opportunity to go to goldfield at the outbreak of the excitement there the rough experience of a mining-camp be not exactly to my taste but it mean a livelihood my real interest have always be in irrigation farming i would rather grow a good crop than mine for gold well i save a little money at goldfield -- save it to buy land but land be not the only consideration the surroundings the people with whom you have to live count for a great deal when you mean to settle permanently excellent declare the doge a good citizen in full fellowship with you neighbor exactly what we want in little river prather have a complexion of that velvety whiteness that never tan he eye be calm yet attractive with a peculiar insinuate charm when he talk that make it seem easy and natural to respond to he wish in listen he have a ingratiating manner that be flattering to the speaker a practical man the doge say to mary that evening the kind we need here he and i have a grand afternoon of it together every one of he question about soil and cultivation be to the point not one argument she ask no mary no time for argument you do like people to agree with you after all she hazard for she do not like prather pooh not a matter of agreement no persiflage no altitudinous conversation of the kind that grow no crop prather want to learn and he be get good clean idea with a trained and accurate mind -- the best possible combination i hope he will stay for the very reason that he be not the kind that take up a plot of land for life on a impulse which usually result in turn on the water and get discourage because nature will not do the rest but he be very favorably impressed he say that after goldfield little river be like paradise -- practical paradise good phrase practical paradise in two or three day the new-comer know everyone in town but though he address the man by they first name they always address he as mr prather in another respect besides he feature he be like jack : he be much give to smile the difference between he smile and jack 's say mr galway who be at one with mary in not like he be that he be sort of a drawing-in kind of smile and jack 's sort of radiate the child develop no interest in he it be evident that he could not tell story except with a effort in he going and coming ever ask pleasant question and pass compliment he be usually accompany by the doge and he attitude toward the old man be the admire deference of disciple for master i be sorry i do not understand that he would say when the doge fall into a scholastic allusion to explain a point i be hard at work when lot of my friend be in college learning may be ruination respond the doge though it would not have be in you case it be the man that count see what you have make of yourself ah yes but i feel that i have miss something when i be settle here i shall be able to make up for lose time with you help sir every pigeonhole in my mind will be open at you call say the doge glowing at the prospect the favor that prather find in the eye of jasper ewold partly account for what favor he find in little river ' eye prather have certainly make a hit with the doge quoth bob worther as the doge get older i reckon he will like compliment better than persiflage but jack could pay a compliment too -- only he never use the ladle it be bob as inspector of ditch and dam who provide a horse for prather to inspect the source of the water supply in keep with a characteristic thoroughness prather want to go up the river into the canyon he make himself a very enjoyable companion on the way draw out all of bob 's best story when they stop in sight of the streak of blue sky through the breach in the mighty wall that have once imprison the ancient lake he be silent for some time while he survey this grandeur of the height with smile contemplation at interval rub the palm of he hand together in a manner habitual with he when he be particularly pleased i guess the same idea have strike you that strike everybody at sight of that seh say bob yes a dam might be practical prather answer but it would take a lot of capital -- a lot of capital on the way back they stop before a dilapidated shanty near the foothill in the midst of a litter yard old man leffert half doze occupy a broken chair since the doge come old man leffert have have to do no work at all a mexican look after he but it have not make he any happier bob explain as they approach howdy yourself growl leffert in answer to bob 's greet he seem to be a character whisper prather to bob as he smile at the prospect to confess the truth i be a little saddle sore and tired i do not get much ride in goldfield i think i 'll stop and rest and get acquaint you will not get much satisfaction but growl that will be all the more fun for I rejoin prather but do not let I keep you no i must be go on i have get some thing to look after before nightfall say bob while prather in a humor proof against any hermit cantankerousness ride into the yard when he return after dark he say laughingly that he have enjoy himself though the conversation be all on one side the next morning he decide to take up the plot of land adjoining jack 's but i shall not be able to begin work for a few week he say i must go to goldfield to settle up my affair before i begin my new career if jack ever come back i wonder what he will say to he new neighbor little river wonder xix look over precipice to mary ewold the pass be a divide line between two appeal the little river side with the green patch of oasis in the distance have a message of peaceful enjoyment of what fortune have provide for she under its spell she see herself content to live within garden wall forever in the land that have give she life grateful for the trickle of intelligence that come by mail from the outside world the other side arouse a mighty restlessness therefore she rarely make that short journey which spread another panorama of space before she but this be one of the afternoon when she welcome a tumult of any kind as a relief from she depression and she go on through the v as soon as she reach the summit seat on a flat-topped rock oblivious of the passage of time of the dream city of the eternal painter she be stare far away where the narrowing gray line between the mountain rim meet the sky she be see beyond the horizon she be see city of memory and reality a great yearning be in she heart all the monotonous level lap of the height which seem without end be a symbol that separate she from she desire she imagine herself in a pullman flash by farm and village in a shop selecting gown view from a high window the human stream of fifth avenue take passage on a steamer hearing again foreign tongue long ago familiar to she ear sense the rustle of great audience before a curtain rise glimpse the mediterranean from a car window feeling herself a unit in the throbbing promenade of the life of many street while she hunger take its fill of a busy world it be hard to do it all in imagination she say to herself even imagination need a occasional nest-egg of reality by way of encouragement a hour on the far side of the pass play the emotional part for she of a storm of tear for many another woman she rejoice in be utterly alone rejoice in the grandeur of the very waste around she as mount guard over the freedom of she thought there be no living speck on the trail which she know lay across the expanse of parched earth to the edge of the blue dome there be not even a bird in the air undisturbed she might think anything pray for anything she might feed the flame of revolt till the fuel of many week ' accumulation have burn itself out and leave she calm in the wisdom and understanding that reconcile she to she portion and freshen to return through galerium to the quiet routine of she daily existence she mind pause in its travels from capital to capital and she be conscious solely of the stark majesty of she surroundings she listen there be no sound the spacious stillness be soothing to she nerve a specific when all the eternal painter 's art fail she close she eye try to realize that great silence as one would try to realize the infinite then faintly she hear a man 's voice singing it seem at first a trick of the imagination but nearer and nearer it come in the fellowship of life joyfully invade the solitude and with a readjustment of she faculty to the expect event she watch the point where the trail dip on a sharp turn of grade above it rise a cowpuncher hat then a silk shirt with a string tie and after that a sage baggage burro with clip ear a solemn-faced pony and a indian jack be watch he step in the uneven path and not until the full length of he have appear and he be flush on the level

this morning she guess that he be about to make up a new story he must have have time for many invention in the ten day of he absence but she welcome any tangent of nonsense that set the right key for the coincidence of they meeting she have refuse to ride to the pass with he and here they be alone together on the pass three or four step so light that they seem to be irresistibly win permission from she and he have sit down on another flat-topped rock close by firio and the baggage train move on up the trail methodically and stop well in the background you know how when you meet a person you be sometimes haunt by a conviction that you have meet he before he begin how exasperated you be not to be able to recall the time and place have you forget where you meet the dinosaur she ask he must have think you very impolite after all the trouble he have take to make you remember he the last time you go through the pass oh the dinosaur and i have patch up a truce because it seem after all that

you father give I a glance at we first meeting which ask the question that have keep recur to I : where have he and i see each other before well she say curiously recall she father 's repeat allusion to this wingfield he strange depression after jack have leave the night before the duel he reticence and animadversion i say nothing about it nor do he i wonder if it have not be a kind of contest between we as to which should be the first to say ` tag ' she smile at this and lean farther back but with the curtain of she eyelash widen in tremulous intensity i know it would come he go on with dramatic fervor such thing do come unexpectedly in a flash when there be a sudden electric connection with some dusty pigeonhole in the mind it be in florence that he and i meet in florence on the road to fiesole florence the road to fiesole mary repeat and the name seem to rouse in she a rapturous recollection she lean forward now she lip apart she eye glowing in place of waste she be see brown roof and the sweep of the tuscan valley and _ we _ meet -- _ you _ and _ i _ we she glance come sharply back from the distance in the astonishment of dilate pupil that draw together in inquiry

with the grandeur of a tight-rope performer who have just do he best thriller as a climax to he turn yes -- yes she breathe with quick-running emphasis out of the mist of fifteen year have come a signal she bent nearer to he in the wonder of a thing find in the darkness of memory which always have the fascination of a communication from another world you want I to come up on the wall she say take up the thread of the story you say it be so easy and you help I up and when i look down at the road i be overcome and fall down all in a heap on the parapet and heaven he gasp live the scene over

in she face though she try to put the question nonchalantly what then how deep run the current of this past association why there be not much else you father come down the path and he big thumb take you in tow i do not see you again a week later mother and i have go to switzerland -- we be always on the move the candor of he glance tell she that this be all as boy and girl they have meet under a italian sky as man and woman they have meet under a arizona sky now the charm of the florence of they affection hold they with a magic touch they be not in a savage setting look out over savage distance but on the piazzale michelangelo look out over the city of renaissance genius which slumber on the refulgent bosom of its past they be oblivious of the eternal painter 's canvass and enjoy raphael 's botticellus 's and andrea del sarto 's possibly the eternal painter in the leniency of philosophic appreciation of they oblivion to he art hazard a guess about the destiny of this pair he could not really have know they destiny no it be impossible to grant he the power of divination for if he have it he might not be so young of heart they talk flit here and there in exclamation each bring a entail of recollection of some familiar enjoy thing and when at last it return to they immediate surroundings the shadow of the range be creep out onto the plain cut by the brilliance of the sun through the v mary rise with a quick self-accusing cry about the lateness of the hour to he it be a call on he resource to delay they departure do you see where that shelf break abruptly he ask it must be the side of a canyon have you ever look down i start to once i should not like to go over the pass again without see if this be really a canyon of any account i feel myself quite a authority on canyon it will be dark before we reach little river she protest ten minute -- only a step and he be appeal in he boyish fashion to have he way nonsense besides i do not care for canyon you still fear then to look down from wall you -- and this decide she on another occasion she have go to the precipice edge and falter she would master she dizziness for once and all he should not know from she any confession of a weakness which be purely of the imagination the point to which he have allude be a immense overhang slab of granite stratum deep set in the mountain side as they approach a thrill of lightness and uncertainty be set she limb a-quiver she elbow be touch he she will drive she foot forward desperately suddenly she be gaze down down down into black depths which seem call irresistibly and melt she power of muscular volition while he with another step be on the very edge lean over and smile she drop back convulsively he be all happy absorption in the face of that abyss how easy for he to topple over and go hurtle into the chasm do not she gasp and blindly tug at he arm to draw he back as he look around in surprise and inquiry she withdraw she hand in a reaction against she familiarity yet do not lower it hold it out with finger spread in expression of she horror serenely he regard she for a moment in she confusion and distress and then smile while the still light of confidence be in he eye he lock he arm in hers before she could protest or resist he have draw she to he side it be just as safe as look off the roof of a porch on to a flower garden he say and why she know not but the fact have come as something definite and settle : she be no longer dizzy or uncertain calmly in the triumph of mind over fear in the glory of a new sensation of power she look down into that gulf of shadow -- look down for a thousand foot where the narrowing sheer wall merge into darkness from this pit to the blue above there be only infinite silence with no movement but he pulse-beat which she could feel in he wrist distinctly he have she fast a pawn of one of he impulse a shiver of revolt run through she he have take this liberty because she have show weakness and she be not weak she have come to the precipice to prove that she be not thank you my little tremor of horror have pass she tell he i can stand without help now he release he hold and she stand quite free of he a glance flash she independence smilingly she look down and smilingly and triumphantly back at he you need not keep you arm up in that fashion ready to assist I it be tire she say with a touch of she old fire of banter over the barrier i be all right now i do not know what give I that giddy turn -- probably sit still so long and look out at the blaze of the desert he sweep she with a look of admiration and they eye meet she look back into the abyss i wish i have such courage he say with sudden tense earnestness courage to master my revulsion against shadow perhaps it will come like a inspiration she answer uncomprehendingly then both be silent until she speak of a stunt little pine three or four hundred foot down in the crotch of a outcrop its sinking root have split a rock over which the other root sprawl in gnarly persistence some pass bird have drop the seed which have find a bed in a pocket of dust from the erosion of time so it have grow and set up housekeeping in its isolation even as the community of little river have in a desert basin beside a water-course the little pine have courage -- the courage of the dwarf she say it be worth more than a whole forest of its majestic cousin in maine how green it be -- greener than they but they rise straight to heaven in they majesty he return to make controversy yes out of the ease of they rich bed in a crowd and wait for the axe and this one in its isolation create something where there be nothing every one of its needle be count in its cost of birth out of the stubborn soil and wait all its life down there for the reward of a look and a word of praise but he go on in the delight of hear she voice in rebuttal the big pine give we the mast of ship and they build house and furnish the kindling for the hardwood log of the hearth the little pine make no pretension it have do more it have give we something without which house be empty : it have give we a thought true he exclaim soberly yield and now all the lively signal of the impulse of action play on he face for you glance and you word of praise it shall pay you tribute he cry i be go down to bring you one of its cluster of spine but jack it be a dangerous climb -- it be late no no no climb at all it be easy if i work my way around by that ledge yonder i see stepping-place all the way how like he while she think only of the pine he have be think how to make a descent how to conquer some physical difficulty already he have start despite she protest i do not want to rob the little pine she call testily i 'll bring a needle then even every needle be precious i 'll bring a dead one then there be no combat he she know when he be headstrong and when he be particularly headstrong he would laugh in he soft way he be laugh now as he take off he spur and toss they aside no climbing in these cart-wheel and i shall have to roll up my chap she go back to the precipice edge to prove to he to prove to herself that she could stand there alone without the moral support of anyone at she side and find that she could she have master she weakness it be as if a new force have be bear in she she feel its stiffen in every fiber as she see he pass around the ledge and start down toward the little pine feel it as something which could build barrier and mount they with a invulnerable guard how would he get past that steep shoulder the worst obstacle confront he at the very beginning of the descent he be hug a rock face feel he way with nothing but a few inch of a project seam between he and the darkness far below he foot slip he body turn half around and she have a second of the horror that she have feel when wait for the sound of leddy 's shot in bill lang 's store she see he outspread hand clutch the seam above watch for they to let go but they hold the foot grope and get its footing again and he work he way out on a shelf he be safe and she drop on she knee weakly still look down at he it be the old story of they relation be this man ever to be subject she to spasm of fear on he account and there he be beam up at she reassuringly while she feel the blood which have go from she face return in a hot flood it bring with it anger in place of fear i do not want it i do not want it she cry down and i want to get it for you i want to get it for you -- for you he voice be a tumult of emotion in the abandon of passionate declaration so long have she hold he back that now when the flood come it have the power of conserve strength burst a dam in wild havoc there be nothing i would not like to do for you mary he cry i would like to pull that pine up for you even if it bleed and suffer i would like to go on do thing for you forever there be not even a movement of she lip in answer it seem to she now that there on the precipice edge while he hold she arm in he the iridescent house of glass have fall about they in a confused dazzling shower of wreckage he have find a opening he have break through the barrier half unconscious of he progress of the chasm itself she wait in a daze and come out of it to see he sweep he hat upward from beside the pine before he reach as far as he could among the branch and with what seem to she the refinement of effrontery and disregard of she wish break off a tawny young branch he wave it to she -- this garland of conquest win out of the jaw of danger which he be ready to throw at she foot from the list no no no she say half aloud she see he start back with he sure step he shoulder swing with the lithe adaptable movement of he body and every step be draw he nearer to a meeting which would be like no other between they soon he would be crunch the glass of the house under that confident tread in the ecstasy of a new part he would be before the opening he have break in the barrier with the jauntiness of one who expect admission he pulse-beat under the touch of she finger at the precipice edge he artery-beat in the _ arroyo _ be hammer in she temple hammer out a decision which when it come bring she to she foot now the shadow be deep all the glory of the sunset in the eternal painter 's chaotic last moment of he day 's work overspread the western sky and from the furnace in which he dip he brush come a blade of rich blaze gold through the pass and lay across the trail it envelop she as half run mindless of she footing slip as she go she hurry toward the other side of galeria when jack wingfield come up over the ledge a pine tassel in he hand he languor of other day transform into high-strung triumphant intensity the sparkle of a splendid hope in he eye only firio be there to welcome he señorita ewold say she no could wait firio explain it be very late she say jack stop as if strike and he feature become a lifeless mask as lifeless as the wall of the canyon he look down at the trophy of he climb and run he finger over the needle slowly again and again in abstraction i understand he say half to himself and then aloud : firio we will not go into town to-night we will camp on the other side by the river _ sí _ i shoot enough quail this afternoon for dinner but jack do not have much appetite and after dinner he do not amuse firio with invention of he fancy he lay long awake he head on he clasped hand look at the star xx a puzzle ambassador a faint aureole of light creep up back of the pass dawn at last jack breathe in relief firio firio up with you oh-yuh yawn firio _ sí sí _ he say rise numbly to he foot and rub he eye with he fist while he try to comprehend a astonishing reversal of custom usually he awaken he camp-mate but this morning he camp-mate have awaken he a half shadow in the semi-darkness jack be already throw the saddle over pd 's back we will get away at once he say firio know that something strange have come over señor jack after he have meet señorita ewold on the pass and now he be convince that this thing have be work in señor jack 's mind all night coffee before we start he inquire ingratiatingly coffee at the ranch jack answer in they expeditious preparation for departure he hum no snatch of song as a paean of stretch muscle and the expansion of he be with the full tide of the conscious life of day and this too be contrary to custom before it be fairly light they be on the road with jack urge pd forward at a trot the silence be soft with the shimmer of dawn all glisten and still the roof and tree of little river take form the moist sweetness of its garden perfumed the fresh morning air in greet to the easy traveller while the maker of garden be yet asleep it be the same hour that mary have hurry forth after she wakeful night to stop the duel in the _ arroyo _ as jack approach the ewold home he have a glimpse of something white a woman 's gown he think that disappear behind the vine he conclude that mary must have rise early to watch the sunrise and draw rein opposite the porch but through the lace-work of the vine he see that it be empty yet he be positive that he have see she and that she must have see he come she be miss the very glorious moment which she have rise to see a rim of molten gold be show in the defile and all the summit of the range be top with flow fire mary he call there be no answer have he be mistake have mental suggestion play he a trick have he eye personify a wish when they see a figure on the step mary he call again and he voice be loud enough for she to have hear if she be awake and near still there be no answer the pass have now become a flaming vortex which bath he in its far-spreading radiance but he have lose interest in sunrise a last backward hungry glance over he shoulder as he start give he a glimpse through the open door of the living-room and he see mary lean against the table look down at she hand which be half clasped in she lap as if she be wait for he to get out of the way thus he understand that he have end they comradeship when he have break through the barrier on the previous afternoon and the only thing that could bring it back be the birth of a feeling in she greater than comradeship he shoulder fall together the rein loosen while pd masterless if not riderless proceed homeward hello jack it be the greet of bob worther the inspector of ditch who be the only man abroad at that hour jack look up with a effort to be genial and find bob closely study he feature in a stare what be the matter bob he ask have my complexion turn green over night or my nose slip around to my ear i be try to make out if you do look like he bob declare like whom what the deuce be the mystery what -- why of course you be the most interested party and the only little riversite that do not know about it seh after all there be some compensation for early rising bob expand with the privilege of be the first to break the news if you would come yesterday you would have see he he go by the noon train he say and proceed with the story of prather jack have never hear of the man before and be obviously uninterested he do not

finger work nervously on the rein and he bite he lip in irritation he be ask a lot of question about you bob add by this time jack have summon back he smile he do not seem to mind if a dozen doctor come to town at the same time as a dozen double do you tell he that i have a cough -- kuh-er he ask casually why no i say you could thrash you weight in wildcat and he say ` well he 'll have to yet ' and then shut up as if he would overspoke himself -- and i judge that he be not the kind that do that often but say jack bob demand in the alarm of local partisanship which apprehend that it may unwittingly have serve a outside interest do you want we to dope it out that you be a invalid we be not be get you in wrong i hope not a bit answer jack with a reassuring slap on bob 's shoulder be he name bennington yes that be it well say jack thoughtfully and with a return of he annoyance he will find I at home when he call and pd know that the rein be still hold in listless hand as he turn down the side street toward the new ranch firio be feel like a astrologer who have lose faith in he crystal ball a interrogation have take the place of he confident _ sí sí _ of desert understanding of the mind of he patron jack have break camp with the precipitancy of one who be eager to be quit of the trail and back at the ranch yet he give he young tree only a pass glance before enter the house he have not wanted coffee on the road yet coffee serve with the crisp odor of bacon accompany its aroma after he bath and return to ranch clothes find no appetite he be as a man whose mind can not hold fast to anything that he be do firio restless worried he eye flick covert glance be frequently in and out of the living-room on one excuse or another what work to-day he ask as he clear away the breakfast dish what have señor jack plan for we to do the work to-day the work to-day jack repeat absently first the mail he nod toward a pile on the table and i shall make ready to stay a long time firio insinuate softly no jack answer to space the pyramid of mail might have be a week 's batch for the doge himself at the bottom be a number of book and above they magazine which jack have subscribe for when he find that they be not on the doge 's list there be only one letter as a first-class postage symbol of the exile 's intimacy with the outside world and out of this tumble a check and a blank receipt to be fill in he tear off the wrapper of the magazine as a means of some sort of physical occupation and roll they into ball which he cast at the waste-basket but neither the contents of the magazine nor those of the newspaper seem to interest he he aspect be that of one wait in a lobby to keep a appointment when he hear step on the porch he sing out cheerily come in but contrary to the habit of little river hospitality he do not hasten to meet he caller and any keenness of anticipation which he may have feel be well mask there enter a man of middle age with close-cropped gray beard clothe in soft flannel the trousers bottom turn up in new york fashion for negligee business suit for that spring to the simple interior of a western ranch house he bring the atmosphere of complex civilization as a thing ineradicably breed into he be it be evident too that he have be use to have he arrival in any room a moment of importance which summon the rapt attention of everybody whether nurse fellow physician or the member of the patient 's family but this time that be lack the young man lean against the table be not visibly impressed hello doctor say jack as unconcernedly as he would have pass the time of day with jim galway in the street hello jack say the doctor jack go just half-way across the room to shake hand then he drop back to he easy position with the table as a rest after he have set a chair for the visitor how do you like little river jack ask i have be here only thirty-six hour answer the doctor avoid a direct answer he be pull off he silk summer glove make the operation a trifle elaborate one which seem to require much attention i come pretty near mistake another man for you but he mole patch save I i do not think you could have grow one out here wonderfully like you have you meet he he glance up as he ask this question which seem the first to occur to he as a warming-up topic of conversation before he come to the business in hand no i have just hear of he jack answer the doctor smile at he glove which he now fold and put in he pocket do not the lecturer to young medical student say divert you patient 's mind to some topic other than himself as you get you first impression now dr bennington draw forward in he chair rest the tip of the long finger of a soft capable hand on the edge of the table and look up to jack in professional candor sweep he with the know eye of the modern confessor of the secret of all manner of mankind with the other hand he draw a stethoscope from he side coat-pocket well jack you can guess what bring I all the way from new york -- just five minute ' work and he give the symbol of examination a flourish in emphasis i do not think i have forget the etiquette of the patient on such occasion jack return it be a easy function in this arizona climate he draw he shirt up from a compact loin and lean middle reveal the arch of he deep chest the flesh of which be healthy pink under neck and face plate with indian tan the doctor 's eye light with the bliss of a critic use to search for flaw at sight of a masterpiece while he conduct the initial plotting with the rubber cup which carry sound to one of the most expensive sens of hearing in america jack be gaze out of the window as if he mind be far away across the cactus-spotted level breathe deep command the doctor jack 's nostril quiver with the indrawing of a great gust of air and he diaphragm swell until he rib be like taut bowstring and you be the pasty-faced weakling that leave my office five year ago -- and you you husky giant have bring I two thousand mile to see if you be really convalescent i hope the trip will do you good say jack sweetly but it be great news that i take back great news say the doctor as he put the stethoscope in he pocket yes return jack slip he head through he shirt you do not find even a speck not a speck no sign of the lesion there be no reason why you should not have go home long ago no jack be fasten he string tie and do this with something of the urban nicety with which the doctor have fold he glove that tie be one of the few inheritance from complex civilization which still have jack 's favor what have you find to do all these year jack be surprise at the question i have just wander about and read and think he explain without develop any sense of responsibility demand the doctor in exasperation i have try to be good to my horse and of late i have take to ranch there be a lot of responsibility in that and care too take the scale for instance a confound little ranch out in this god-forsaken place that a swede immigrant might run no the swede be not particularly good at irrigation though better than the dutch you see the hollander be use to have so much water that -- jack be lean idly against the table again the fashionable practitioner accustom to have he word accept at they cost price in gold break in hotly : it be past all understand you the heir to twenty million be it twenty now jack ask softly and sadly nearer thirty probably and shirk you duty shirk and for what -- for what jack face around the doctor meet a calm eye that be quizzically challenging pause abruptly feel that in some way he have be catch at a professional disadvantage in he outburst of emotion do not you like little river ask jack i should be bore to death the doctor admit honestly well you see this air never heal a lesion for you you never utter a prayer to it for strength with every breath and doctor jack hesitate while he lip be half open show he even tooth slightly apart in the manner of a break in a story to the child where he expect they to be very attentive to what be come you can take a piece of tissue and analyze it yes a piece of brain tissue and find all the blood-vessel but not what a man be think can you until you can take a precipitate of he thought -- the very thought he be unconscious of himself -- and put they under a microscope why there must be a lot of guesswork about the source of all unconventional human action jack laugh over he invasion of psychology and when he laugh in a certain way the impulse to join he be strong as mary first find on the pass so the doctor laugh partly in relief perhaps that this uncertain element which he be find in jack have not yet prove explosive that would make a capital excuse for a student flunk in examination he say it might be a worthy one -- not that i say it ought to pass he now jack the doctor begin afresh the reassure force of he personality again in play he take a step and raise he hand as if he would put they on jack 's shoulder one could imagine he drive hypochondria out of many a patient 's mind by thus make he own vigorous optimism flow down from he fingertip while he look into the patient 's eye but he hand remain in the air though jack have be only smile at he this be not the way to handle this patient something tell he trained sensitive instinct in time and he let he hand fall in semblance of a gesture of protest give a shrug and come directly to the point very genuinely well jack -- you father yes and jack 's face be still and blank while shadow play over it in a war among themselves he do not even tell I you be come he add perhaps he fear that it would give you time to develop a cough or you would start overland to chihuahua so i should miss you jack he need you all that fortune wait for you now that i be strong yes he do not come out to see I even during the first year when i have not the health to go to he nor do he think to come with you he -- he be a very busy man explain the doctor in ready championship and yet he look away from jack and when he look back it be with a appeal to conscience rather than to filial affection be it right to remain however much you like this desert life have you any excuse yes a overwhelming one exclaim jack in a voice that be high-pitched and determine while he eye burn and no trace of humor remain on lip that be as firm as the outline of he chin yes one that thrill I from head to foot with the steady ardor of the soldier who make a siege i -- i -- you be beyond I then you will stay you be not come home yes jack answer in another mood but one equally rigid i be come at once that be all settle last night under the star i have find the courage the courage to go to twenty million gasp the doctor but -- good you will go that be enough why should not we take the same train back he go on enthusiastically i shall be come through here in less than a week you see i be so near californium that i simply have to steal a few day with my sister who can not come east on account of she health i have be so tie down to practice that i have not see she for fifteen year that will give you time to arrange you affair how about it it would be delightful but -- jack be hesitate no i will refuse you see i ride horseback when i enter this valley for the first time and i should like to ride out in the way i come just sentiment jack exclaim the doctor he be cast about how to express he suspicion when something electric check he -- a current that begin in jack 's measure glance jack be not mention that he word be be question but something still and effective that come from far away out on the untrod desert be in the room it fall on the nerve of the ambassador from the court of complex civilization like a sudden hush on a city 's traffic jack break the silence by ask in a tone of lively hospitality : you will join I at luncheon i should like to answer the doctor but i can catch a train on the other trunk line that will give I a few more hour with my sister and what shall i wire you father have you any suggestion why that he will be able to judge for himself in a few day how near cure i be you will wire he the date of you arrival yes jack say the doctor at the door that remark of yours about the analysis of brain tissue and of thought put a truth very happily come and see I and let I know how you get on good-by he take he departure thoughtfully rather than with a sense of triumph over the success of a two-thousand-mile mission in the name of twenty million xxi good-by little river it be the thing thrill he with the ardor of a soldier prepare for a siege that send jack to the ewold ' later in the morning he have come determine to finish the speech that he have call up to mary from the canyon as he cross the cement bridge ignacio appear on the path and take he position there obdurately instead of stand to one side with a nod as usual to let the caller pass señorita ewold be not at home he announce before jack have speak not even in the garden no señor but she will be back soon i do not think so ignacio 's face be as blank as a wall but knowingly authoritatively blank he brown eye glisten with cold assurance he seem to have become the interpreter of a message in keep with mary 's flight from the pass and she withdrawal from the porch when she have see jack approach here be a new barrier which do not permit even banter across the crest she must know that he be go for the news of he approach departure have already spread through the town she have choose not to see he again even for a farewell for a little time he stand in think while ignacio remain steadfast on the path watchful perhaps for the devil in señor do not care to appear suddenly jack 's feature glow with

they have find they first thought in common in the ozone which have mean life to they both he do not look up at the sky change as he climb the wind path worn by moccasined foot before the persian march to thermopylae he mind be too occupied make picture of its own in glowing anticipation to have any interest in outside picture this path be narrow here at least she must pause and she must listen every turn which show another empty stretch ahead send he spirit soar then he see a pony with a empty side-saddle on the shelf a few step more and he see mary she be seat with the defile at she back she hand clasp over she knee in this position as in every position which she naturally take she have a pliant and personal grace the welter of light of the low sun be ablaze in she face she profile have a luminous wistfulness she lash be half close at once retain the vision of the panorama at she foot as a thing of atmospheric enjoyment and shut it out from the intimacy of she thought and more envelop than the light be the silence which hold she in a spell as still as the rock themselves wait on time 's dispensation where time be nothing yet the soft movement of she bosom with she even breath triumph in a life supreme and palpitant over all that dead world thus he drink she in before the crunch of a stone under he heel warn she of he presence and set she breath go and come in quick gust as she wheel around half rise and then drop back to a position as still as before with a trace of new dignity in she grace while she starkness of inquiry gradually change to stoicism mary i come upon you very suddenly he say yes -- a bare echo monosyllable he step to one side to let firio and he little cavalcade pass all the while she continue to look at he through the screen of she half-closed lash in a way that set she repose and charm apart as something precious and cold and baffling now he realize that he have make a breach in the barrier of they old relation only to find himself in a garden whose flower fall to ash at he touch he see the light that envelop she as a armor far less vulnerable than any wall and the splendor of she be grow in he eye jag ear 's bell with they warm and merry note become a faint tinkle that be lose in the depths of the defile the two be alone on the spot where the eternal painter have introduce they so simply as jack and mary and where he as the easy traveller have listen to she plead for he own life it be he turn to plead she be not to be win by fight leddy or tear up pine-tree by they root that armor be without a joint a lance would bend like so much tin against its plate and yet there must be some alchemy that would make it melt as a mist before the sun it be tenant by a be all sentiency which see he through she visor as a passer-by in a gallery but one in armor do not fly from passer-by as she have fly while he be climb up the canyon wall with he pine-tree branch i have learn now to look over any kind of a precipice

respite from she evident severity as he drop to a half-lying posture near she overhead the eternal painter be throw in the smoky purple of a false thunderhead sweep it away with the promise of a downpour rolling in pile of silver cloud and draw they out into filmy finger melt into a luminous blue one can never tire of this he say tentatively to I it be all she answer in a absorption with the scene that make he as inconsequential as the rock around she and you never long for city with they swift current and busy eddy he ask city be life the life of humanity and i be human i -- the unfinished sentence sink into the silence of thing inexpressible or which it be purposeless to express she voice suggest the tinkle of jag ear 's bell float away into space if a precipitate be take from she forehead in keep with jack 's suggestion to dr bennington it would have be mercury which be so tangible to the eye and intangible to the touch press it and it break into little globule only to be shake together in a coherent whole if there be joy or pain in the break either one must be glitter and immeasurable but little river be best she add after a time speak not to he but devoutly to the oasis of green in the crystal air little river seem so near that one could touch the roof of the house with the fingertip of a extended arm and yet so diminutive in the spacious bosom of the plateau that it might be set in the palm of the hand jack be as one afraid of he own power of speech a misplace word might send she away as oblivious of he as a globule of mercury roll free from the grasp here be a mary unfathomed of all he hazard of study undreamed of in all he flight of fancy it be my last view he begin i have say all my good-by in town i be go covertly fearfully he watch the effect of the news at least now she would look around at he he would no longer have to talk to a profile and to the golden mist of the horizon about the greatest thing of he life but there be no sign of surprise not even a inclination of she head yes she tell the horizon and after a little silence add : the time have come to play another part she ask the question of the horizon without any trace

be in a monotone of quiet explanation he do not even tell you until last night until after we meeting on the other side of the pass it be strange strange he repeat in the insistence of wonder he see the lash part a little then quiver and close as she lift she gaze from the horizon rim to the vortex of the sun then she smile wearily he like a joke she say probably he enjoy he knowledge of you secret and want to see if i would guess the truth before you be through play you part but the part be not a part he say with the emphasis of fire creep along a fuse it be real i do not want to leave

and if i seek victory i see that i be be beat while i make a profession of you not of gardening yes of you i could confess it to all the world and its ridicule jack you be dramatic if she would only once look at he if he could only speak into she eye if she breath do not come and go so regularly why do i take to the trail after pedro nogale strike at I with he knife because i see the look on you

creep into she tone the urgency of wish to have do with a scene which she be bear with the fortitude of tighten nerve it be the million that send I out here with a message when i do not much care about anything and they message be : ` we do not want to see you again if you be to be forever a weakling get strong for we power be to the strong get strong or do not come back ' yes for the first time since he have begin he story she look fairly at he it be as if the armor have melt with sympathy and pity and she in the pride of the poverty of little river be arm with a samaritan kindliness

first of a precipice 's edge i come to enjoy look over into abyss and in spend a whole day climb down into they depths while firio wait in camp and at time i would cry out : ` million i be strong i be not afraid of you i be not afraid of anything ' in the day when i know i could never be acceptable as they master i know i be in no danger of ever have to face they when i have grow strong less than ever do i want to face they i know not why but i see shadow i look into another kind of depths -- mental depths -- which hold a message that i fear so i procrastinate stay on in the air which have

corner remember he have a long reach with he old paleozoic tail luck with a laugh through she tear a laugh with tremulous cheer in it and yet with the ring of a key in the lock of a gate unsteadily he bent over and take she hand in he press he lip to they yes luck he repeat and half staggering turn toward the defile luck she call after he when he be out of sight luck she call to the silence of the pass three day with the trail and the eternal painter mock he when the singing of spanish verse that go click with the beat of horse-hoof in the sand sound hollow as the refrain of vain memory and from the step of a pullman he have a final glimpse of firio 's mournful face with its dark eye shine in the light of the station lamp firio have in he hand a paper a sort of will and testament give he at the last minute which make he master in fee simple of the ranch where he have be servant with the provision that the doge of little river might store he overflow of book there forever part ii he find himself xxiii label and ship behold jack clothe in the habiliment of conventional civilization take from the stock of ready-made suiting in a el paso store they be of the moscowitz and guggenheim type the very latest and nattiest as advertise in popular print the dealer say that no gentleman could be well dress without they he want to complete the transformation with a cream-colored fedora or a brown derby i 'll wait on the thirty-third degree a little longer say jack fondle the flat-brimmed cowpuncher model of affectionate predilection swing on a hook on the sleeper with the sway of the train its company be soothing to he all the way across the continent the time be march that season of the northern year when winter grow stale have a gritty sticky taste and the relief of spring seem yet far away after the desert air the steam heat be stifle and nauseate jack 's head be a barrel about to burst its hoop he skin dry like a mummy 's he muscle in a starchy misery from lack of exercise he feel box up a express package label and ship when he crawl into he berth at night it be with a sense of give himself up to asphyxiation at the whim of strange god if you have ever come back to town after six month in the wood six month far from the hysteria of titter electric bell the brassy honk-honk of automobile the clang of surface car and the screech of they wheel on the rail multiply you period of absence by ten add a certain amount of desert temperament and you will vaguely understand how the red corpuscle be raise rebellion in jack 's artery wall on the morning of he journey 's end from the ferryboat on the dull-green bosom of the river he first renew he memory of the spectral and forbid abyss and pinnacle of new york here time be everything here man have do he mightiest in contrive mass to imitate the architectural chaos of genesis a mantle of chill smoky mist form the dome of heaven in which a pale suffused yellowish spot alone bespeak the existence of a sun in the universe in keep with he promise to dr bennington he have wire to he father name he train and in a few minute wingfield sr and wingfield jr would meet for the first time in five year jack be conscious of a faster beating of he heart and a feeling of awesome expectancy as the crowd debouch from the ferryboat at the exit to the street a big limousine be wait the gilt initial on the door leave no doubt for whom it have be send but there be no one to meet he no one after he long absence except a chauffeur and a footman who glance at jack sharply after the exchange of a corroborative nod between they the footman advance if you please mr wingfield he say take jack 's suit case what would jim galway think of I now think jack he put he head inside the car cautiously another box he think this time aloud you have the check for it sir ask the footman think that jack be use the english of the mother island for trunk no that be all my baggage in the taper cut-glass vase between the two front window-panel of the box be a rose -- a symbol of the luxury of the twenty million evidently put there regularly every morning by direction of they master its freshness and color appeal to jack he take it out and press it to he nostril just need the morning sun and the dew to be perfect he say to the amaze attendant and i will walk if you will take the suit case to the house he keep the rose which he twirl in he finger as he saunter across town now pause at curb corner to glance back in thoughtful survey now look aloft at the peak of broadway which lay beyond the foothill of the river-front avenue all to I what the desert be to other folk he muse desert without any cactus or mesquite all the trail cross one another in a maze a boxed-up desert -- box and box pile on top of one another everybody in harness and attach by a invisible unbreakable inelastic leash to a box whither he bear he honey or go to nurse he broken wing -- so it seem to I and very headachy at madison square he be at the base of the range itself and halt on the corner of twenty-third street and the avenue he be a statue as aloof as the statue of farragut from he surroundings salt sea spray ever whisper in the atmosphere around the old sailor how st gauden create it and keep it there in the heart of new york be he secret possibly the sculptor put some of he soul into it as young michael angelo do into he young david it be a great thing to put some of you soul into a thing whether it be drive a nail or moulding a piece of clay into life there be man who pause before the old admiral and see the cutwater of man-of-war 's bow and hear the singing of the signal halyard as they rise with the command to close in perhaps the eternal painter have put a little of he soul into the heart of jack for some busy marcher of the avenue trail as they glance at he see the free desert and hear hoof-beat in the sand other see a tan westerner kiss he hand to diana of madison square garden probably think he mad next perform another sentimental errand for the doge of little river he gaze rise along the column of the metropolitan tower its height be half shroud in mist through which glow the gold of the lantern oh bully bully he think the only sun in sight a manufacture one shine on top of a manufacture mountain it be a big business build a mountain only when god almighty scatter so many ready-made one about why take the trouble he conclude or so it seem to I he add sadly in due appreciation of the utterly reactionary mood of a man who have be box up for a week now he turn toward a quarter which he have thus far keep out of the compass of observation he look up the jagged range of broadway where over a terra-cotta pile float a crimson flag with john wingfield in big white letter my mountain my box my million he breathe half audibly how the people whom he pass they face speak city keenness of ambition must envy he position how little reason they have to envy he he think as he walk around the great building and see he name glare at he in gilt letter over the plate-glass window and on all the delivery wagon open-mouthed for the package be wheel out under the long glass awn a whole block now yes the doctor be right it must be thirty instead of twenty million he conclude as he vision sweep the straight-line window-checkered mass of the twelve story and i do wish we have a tower if one could go up on top of a tower and look out over the range now and then and breathe deep it would help when he enter the main door he pause in a maze gaze at the acreage of counter man by clerk and the aisle swarm with shopper under the glare of the big electric globe and listen to the babble of shrill talk the call of the elevator boy the cough of the pneumatic tube and the clang of the elevator door it be all like some devilishly complicated dream from which he would never awake he must have a little time in order to orient himself before he could think rationally the roar of the train still obsess he the air in the store seem more stifle than that of the sleeper so he decide that rather than be shoot up into the presence by the elevator he would gradually scale the height ascend stairway after stairway he range back and forth over the floor a stranger in he own wonderland when he reach the eleventh floor with only one more to the office the whole atmosphere seem suddenly to turn rare with expectancy a rustle to run through all the goods on the counter the very paris gown among which he be stand to be call to martial attention the boss he hear one of the model girl say turn to follow she nod toward the stairway jack see two-third of the way up the broad flight a man past middle age in dark gray suit and neutral tie rub he palm together as he survey a stratum of he principality the sight of he to jack be like the touch of a myriad electric needle that prick sharply without exhilaration the boss be likely to run up that way any time of the day say the model girl to a customer and what he do not see do not count not much older not much change think jack and he realization of the disinterestedness of he observation tip the needle with acid in the sharpness of the master 's button-counting survey there be swift finality and he impression complete analyze docket for reference he run on up the flight with light step still rub the palm of he hand in the unctuously well-contained and appreciative sense of he power to jack he be a fascinating grand distant figure this of he own father yet mortally near if the model girl have have the same keenness of observation for what be bear in the face as for what be wear on the back she could not have fail to note the strong family resemblance between the young man standing near she and the man who have pause on the stairway this glimpse of he father 's mastery of every detail of that organization which he have build this glimpse of cool self-centered authority only remind jack of he own ignorance and flightiness in view of all that would be expect of he he know less than one of the cash girl about how to run the store a duel with leddy be a simple matter beside this battle he have to wage he mount the last flight of stair into a area of glass-paneled door behind which the creative business of the great concern be conduct out of one marked private closing it softly and step softly come a round-shouldered stoop man of middle age with the apprehensive and palliating manner of a long-service private secretary who have many thing to remember and many person to appease with explanation it be evident that peter mortimer have just come from the presence at sight of jack he draw back in a surprise that break into a beam delight which play over he tired and wrinkled feature in ecstasy jack jack you do it

think of the last time i see you it be then that the secretary have see a jack with he eye moist a jack pasty-faced hollow-cheeked and in what be a revolutionary outburst for a unit in the office peter mortimer have put he arm around the boy in a cry for the success of the odyssey for health which the heir be about to begin and mortimer 's word be sweet while the word of the farewell from the other side of the glass-paneled door marked private be acrid with the disappointed hope of the speaker you have always be a weakling jack and i have have little to say about you rearing go out to the desert and stay -- stay till you be strong declare the voice of strength as if glad to be free of the sight of weakness in its own image father do not come to meet I jack observe questioningly now to mortimer he be very busy -- he do not feel certain about the nature of you telegram -- he -- and mortimer 's impulse withdraw into the shell of the professional private secretary i wire that he should see for himself if i be well so he shall say jack turn toward the door yes -- that will be all right -- yes there be no one with he mortimer in the very instinct of long practice be about to go in to announce the visitor but pause as jack enter whatever else may have be in he eye there be no moisture xxiv in the citadel of the million john wingfield sr sit at a mahogany table without a single drawer in the center of a large room with bare green-tinted wall he oculist have say that green be the best color for the eye beside the green blotting-pad in front of he be a pile of papers these

habit a belief of he singularly well-ordered mind in the mastery of the teem detail that throb under the thin sole of he soft kid shoe on the other side of the pad be the telephone and beyond it the supreme implement of he will a row of pearl-topped push-button the story of john wingfield sr 's rise and career as the lieutenant of the office and the battalion of the shopping floor know it be not the story perhaps as dr bennington or peter mortimer know it but then doctor and private secretary be suppose to hold they secret there be little out of the commonplace in the world 's accept version you may hear its like from the moneyed host at he dinner table in new york or as he show you over the acre of he country estate enthuse with a personal narrative of conquest which be to he unique john

practice a profession make no appeal birth and boyhood in poverty have teach he from want of money the power of money he seek the center of the market-place at sixteen he be a clerk mark by he industry not less than by he engaging manners on six dollar a week in the little store that be the site of he present triumph of course he become a partner and then owner it be he frequent remark when he turn reminiscent that if he could only get as good clerk as he be in he day he would soon have a monopoly of supply new york and its environs with all it eat and wear and need to furnish its house

and he be angry with himself over he inability to concentrate he mind concentration be he god he could turn from lace-buyer to floor-walker with the quickness of the swing of a electric switch concentrate and he be oblivious to everything but the subject in hand he be in one of the moment of apprehension half stare at the button on the desk rather than at the papers when he hear the door open without warn and look up to see a lean sturdy height fill the doorway and the light from the window full on a bronzed and serene face more than ever be jack like david come over the hill in he incarnation of sleep energy instead of a sling he carry the rise into the abode of the nicely govern rule of longevity come the atmosphere of some invasive spirit that would make the stake of life the foam on the crest of a charge in a splendid moment the spirit of señor do not care pause inquiringly almost apologetically as some soldier in dusty khaki might if he have march into a study unaware jack be wait wait and smile for he father to speak in a swift survey he feature transfix at first with astonishment then glowing with pride the father half rise from he chair as if in a impulse to embrace the prodigal but he pause he feel that something under he control be get out of he control he feel that he have be trick the boy must have be well for a long time yes but he be well that be the vital point he be well and magnificent in he vigor the father make another movement and still jack be wait inquire yet not advance and john wingfield sr wish that he have go to the station he wish that he have pay a visit to arizona this thought work in he mind supply jack 's attitude with a aspect which make the father hesitate and then drop back into he chair confuse and uncertain for the first time in he own office well jack you -- you surely do look cure he say awkwardly you see i -- i be a little surprised to see you at the office i send the limousine for you think you would want to go straight to the house and wash off the dust of travel do not you connect yes thank you father -- and when you do not meet I -- i -- i be very busy i mean to but something interrupted -- i -- the father stop confound by he own hesitation of course say jack he speak deferentially understandingly i know how busy you always be yet the tone be such to john wingfield sr 's ear that he eye jack cautiously sharply in the expectancy that almost any kind of undisciplined force might break loose from this muscular giant whom he be try to reconcile with the jack whom he have last see i think i would stretch my leg so i come over to the store to see how it have grow say jack i do not interrupt -- for a moment he sit down on the chair opposite he father 's and lay he fade cowpuncher hat and the rose on the desk they look odd in the company of the pushbutton and the pile of papers in that neutral-toned room which be chill in its monotony of color and though jack be almost boyishly penitent in the manner of one who come before parental authority after he have be in mischief still john wingfield sr could not escape the dead weight of a impression that he be speak to a stranger and not to he own flesh and blood he wish now that he have show affection on jack 's entrance he have a desire to grip the brown hand that be on the edge of the desk finger the rose stem but the lateness of the demonstration its futility in make up for he previous neglect and some subtle influence radiate from jack 's person restrain he it be apparent that jack might sit on in silence indefinitely in a desert silence well jack i hear you have a ranch say the father with a faint effort at jocularity yes and a great crop of alfalfa answer jack happily and it seem that all the time you be away you have never use you allowance so it have just be pile up for you i do not need it i have quite sufficient from the income of my mother 's estate yes -- you mother -- i have forget naturally i prefer to use that when i be of so little service to you unless i get strong as you say jack say very quietly now come another silence the silence of luminous unsounded depths conceal that in the mind which have never be speak or even take form jack 's garden of word have dry up as he ranch would dry up for want of water he rise to go grope for something that should express proper contrition for waste year but it refuse to come he pick up the rose and the hat while the father regard he with stony wonder which say : be you mine or be you not what be the nature of this new strength on what will it turn for jack 's feature have set with a strange firmness and he eye look into he father 's have a steady light it seem as if he might stalk out of the office forever and nothing could stop he but suddenly he flash he smile he have look about search for a talisman and find it in the rose which set he garden of word abloom again this room be so bare it must be lonely for you he say would not it be a good idea to cheer it up a bit to have this rise in a vase on you table where you could see it instead of ride about in a empty automobile box why there be a whole cold storage booth full of they down on the first floor say the father yes i see they in they icy prison under the electric light bulb the bead of water on they be like tear of longing to get out for the joy of they swan song under a woman 's smile or beside a sick bed say jack in the glow of real enthusiasm good line for the ad writer he father exclaim instinctively you always do have fanciful idea jack yes i suppose i have he say with some surprise and very thoughtfully i suppose that i be bear with they and never weed they out no doubt and the father frown survey the broad shoulder before he he be think how nothing but aimlessness and fantasy and everything out of harmony with the career to come have be encourage in the son but he see soberness come into jack 's eye and with it the pressure of a certain resoluteness of purpose and now jack speak again a trifle sadly as if guess he father 's thought it will be a case of weed for I in the future will not it he ask wanly as he rise i be full of foolish idea that be just bind to run away with I jack jack john wingfield sr put he hand out to the shoulder of he son and grip they strongly and for a second let he own weight half rest on that sturdy column which he sense under the grip he pale face the paleness of the type that never tan flush jack come he say he permit himself something like real dramatic feeling as he signal he son to follow he out of the office and lead the way to a corner of one of the balcony where under the light from the glass roof of the great central court he could see down the tier of floor to the jewelry counter which sparkle at the bottom of the well look look he exclaim rub he palm together with a peculiar crisp sound all sell my goods all build from the little store where i begin as a clerk it be -- it be immense gasp jack and he feel a dizziness and confusion in gaze at this kind of a abyss and it be only begin it be to go on grow and grow you see why i want you to be strong jack why it would not do to be weak if you have all this responsibility this be a form of apology for he farewell to jack but the message be the same : he have not want a son who should be of he life and heart and ever he in fault and illness this be the recognizable one of the shadow between they now recall he have want a fresh physical machine into which he could blow the breath of he own masterful being and instil the cunning of he experience he see in this straight clean-limbed youth at he side the hope of jack 's babyhood fulfil in the projection of he own ego as a living thing after he himself be go and it be to go on grow and grow in my name and you name -- john wingfield jack be swallow spasmodically he moisten he lip he grasp the balcony railing so tight that he knuckle be white knob on the bronze back of he hand the father in he enthusiasm hardly notice this what could not i have do he add if i have have all this to begin with all that you will have to begin with jack manage a smile rather thin and waver yes i be go to try my best all i ask you have I for a teacher and i know one or two little thing say the father fairly grin in the transmission of he joke now you must be short on clothes he add so you can get something ready-made downstairs while you have some make at thompson 's do not you buy you clothes you best clothes i mean in you own store jack ask it be he first question in get acquaint with he future property no we cater to a little bigger class of trade -- one of the many twist of the business be the answer and now we 'll meet at dinner shall we and have a good long talk he conclude close the interview and turn to the door he mind snap back to the matter he be about to take up when he have be interrupt with more eagerness than ever now that he egoism thrill with a still greater purpose i -- i leave my hat on you desk jack explain as he follow he father into the office well you do not want to be carry package about say john wingfield sr that be hardly the fashion in new york though john wingfield 's son can make it so if he want to i 'll have that flat-brimmed western one send up to the house and you can fit out with another when you go downstairs for clothes that be i suppose you will want to keep this as a memento eh and he hold out the cowpuncher sweep it with a sardonic glance no jack answer decisively out of the impulse that come with the sight of the veteran companion that have shield he from the sun on the trail it be good to have any kind of a impulse after he giddiness on the balcony at sight of all the phantasmagoria of detail that he must master if he be to be equal to this future there must be a end of temptation he must shake himself free of the last clinging bit of chrysali of the old life he amaze father see the child of the desert where convention be make by you fancy and the supply of water in you canteen go to the window and raise the sash lean out he let the hat drop into broadway with he eye just over the line of the ledge while he watch it fall dip and glide to the foot of a messenger boy who pick it up wave it gleefully aloft before put it over he cap and with mock stride of grandeur go he way that give he a lot of pleasure -- and a remarkably quick system for deliver goods be not it say jack cheerfully yes i should say so assent he father return to he seat dinner at seven he call before the door close and as he finger seek one of the push-button it rest for a moment on the metal edge of the socket he head bow while a indefinable emotion mixed of prophecy and recollection must have flutter through the routine channel of he vigorous mind xxv but with you ` yes sir ' as jack come out of the office mortimer appear from a adjoining room in furtive mouselike curiosity not much damage do say jack in happy relief from the ordeal i be without a hat but i have the rose he hold it up before mortimer 's worn kindly face that have be so genuine in welcome yes i must have keep it to decorate you peter ineffectually in timorous confusion the old secretary protest while jack fasten it in he buttonhole and you be go to help I be not you peter jack go on seriously you be go to hold up a finger of warn when i get off the course i be to be practical matter-of-fact there be to be a end to all fantastic idea a end to all fantastic idea but it be hardly accord to the gospel of the matter-of-fact to take burleigh the fitter out to luncheon jack might excuse himself on the ground that he have not yet begin he apprenticeship and have several hour of freedom before he first lesson at dinner this ecstasy of a recess perhaps make he lay aside the derby which the clerk say be very become and choose a softer head-covering with a bit of feather in the band which the clerk with positive enthusiasm say be still more become at all event it be easy on he temple while the derby be stiff and binding and conducive to a certain depression of spirit burleigh the fitter be almost as old as mortimer he rise to the exceptional situation he eye light as he survey the form to be clothe with a professional gratification unsurpassed by that of dr bennington in plot jack 's chest with a stethoscope yes sir we will have that dinner-jacket ready to-night sir depend upon it -- and could not i show you something in cheviot jack break another precedent a wingfield he decide to patronize the wingfield store because he see how supremely happy every order make burleigh you can do it as well as thompson 's he ask with you yes sir -- though thompson be a great expert on round shoulder but with you yes sir when the business of measuring be over while burleigh peer triumphant over the pile of cloth from which the masterpiece be to be fashion jack say that he have a rip appetite and he do not see why he and burleigh should not appease they hunger in company burleigh gasp then he grin in abandon delight and slip off he shiny coat and little tailor 's apron that bristle with pin they go to a restaurant of reputation which jack say be in keep with the occasion when a man change he habit from arizona simplicity to urban multiplicity of course and what do burleigh like burleigh admit that if he be a plutocrat he would have caviar at least once a day and caviar appear in a little glass cup set in the midst of crack ice flank by crisp toast after caviar come other thing to burleigh 's taste he be have such a awesomely grand feast that he be tongue-tied but jack could never eat in silence until he have forget how to tell story so he tell burleigh story of the trail and of life in little river in a way that reflect the desert sunshine in burleigh 's eye burleigh think that he would like to live in little river almost anyone might after hear jack 's description in the joy of its call to himself now if you would trust I say burleigh when they leave the restaurant i should like to send out for some cloth not in stock for a couple of suit and could not i make you up three or four fancy waistcoat with a little color in they -- the right color to go with the cloth you can carry a little color -- decidedly yes yes i rather like color say jack succumb to temptation though he feel that the heir to great responsibility ought to dress in the most neutral of tone and i should like to select the tie to go with the suit and a few shirt just to carry out my scheme -- a kind of professional triumph for I you see may i go ahead say jack and you can depend on you evening suit to be up in time but i be go to rush a little broader braid on those ready-made trousers -- you can carry that too burleigh conclude when they part jack turn into fifth avenue before he have go a block the bulky eminence of a fifth avenue stage awaken he imagination how could anybody think of confinement in a taxicab when he might ride in the elephant 's howdah of that top platform enjoy mortal superiority over surround humanity jack hang the howdah with silken streamer and set a mahout 's turban on the head of the man on the seat in front of he while the glisten semi-oval top of the limousine float in the mist of the rise grade from madison square to forty-second street swarm and halt in a kind of blind cramped _ pas de quatre _ from cross street to cross street amid the break surge of pedestrian such a throbbing of machine motion he think that i do not see how anybody can have a emotion of he own without bump into somebody else be it be a scene of another age and world to he puzzling overpower dismal mock he with a sense of loneliness that he have never feel on the desert could he ever catch up with this procession which have all the time be move on in the five year of he absence could he learn to talk and think in the regulated manner of the traffic rule of convention the few chum of he brief home school-day be long away from the fellowship of academy they have settle in they groove with established intimacy if he find he own flock he could claim admission to the fold only with the golden key of he million rather than by the password of kindred understand the trip finely-clad woman human flower of all the maelstrom of urban toil in they detachment seem only to bring up a visualize picture of mary what would he not like to do for she he wish that he could pick up the waldorf and set it on the other side of the street as a proof of the overmastering desire that possess he whenever she be in he mind and the doge he be the wisest man in the world with a nod of well-considered and easy generosity jack present he with the new public library and then all the people on the sidewalk vanish and the building melt away into sunswept level and the avenue be a trail down which mary come on she pony in the resplendent sufficiency of he dream great heaven he warn himself and i be to take my first lesson in run the business this evening what perfect lunacy come from mistake the top of a fifth avenue stage for a howdah xxvi the portrait of a lady how thankful he be that the old brick corner mansion in madison avenue with age alone to recommend its architecture of the seventy -- let it stand for what it be -- have not be replace by one of stone freshly polished each year the butler who open the door be new and stiffer than the one of the old day but he see that the broad hall with the stair run across the rear in they second flight be little more changed than the exterior five year since he have leave that hall he be in the thrall of anticipation incident to see old association with the eye of manhood the butler make to take he hat but jack oblivious of the attention go on to the doorway of the drawing-room he look center on a portrait that face the door in this place of honor he see a gainsborough he utter a note of pained surprise there use to be another portrait here where be it he demand the butler who have hear that the son of the house be a invalid have not recover from he astonishment at the appearance of health of the return prodigal upstairs sir he answer when mr wingfield get this prize last year sir -- though the butler have speak hardly a dozen word he become conscious of something atmospheric that make he stop in the confusion of one who find that he have be garrulous with a explanation that do not explain please take this upstairs and bring back the other say jack yes sir you will be go to you room sir and while -- the butler have a feeling of a troublesome future between two master now please say jack settle into a chair to wait the gainsborough countess with she sweeping plume she rich fleshy soft tone she charming affectation which give you after the art interest no more human interest in she than in a draped model be carry upstairs and back come the picture that it have displace the frame still bear at the bottom the title portrait of a lady under which it have be exhibit at the salon many year ago it be by a young artist young then name sargent he have the courage of he method this youngster no less than hal who also work he wonder with little paint when this suit he genius best the gauze of the gown where it blended with the background at the edge of the line of arm be so thin seemingly make by a single brush-stroke that it almost show the canvas a purpose in that gauze : the thinness of transparency of character the eye of the portrait alone seem deep they be lambent and dark look straight ahead inquiringly yet in the knowledge that no answer to the great riddle could change the course of she step in the blind alley of a life whose tenement wall be light with she radiance you could see through the gown through the flesh of that frail figure so lack in sensuousness yet so glowing with a quiet fire to the soul itself she seem of such a delicate chaste fragility that she could be shatter by a single harsh touch there would be no outcry except the tinkle of the fragment the feeling of anyone who witness the breaking and hear the tinkle would be a criterion of he place in the wide margin between nerveless barbarism and sensitive gentility i give i give i give be she message for a long time he have no measure of it jack sit study the portrait set clear in many scene of memory in review it have be a face as changeful as the travels ever full of quick light and quick shadow he have have flash of it as it be in the portrait in its very triumph of resignation he have know it laugh with story of fancy which she tell he sympathetic in tutorial illumination as she give he lesson and bring out the meaning of a line of poetry or a painting beset by the restlessness which mean another period of travel intense as fire itself grip he hand in hers in a defiance of possession in mood when both its sadness and its playfulness say i do not care and again flee from he presence to hide she tear it be with the new sight of man 's maturity and soberness that he now see he mother feel the intangible and indestructible feminine majesty of she feeling she fragility which have bring forth she living soul in its beauty and impressionableness as a link with the cause of he odyssey believe that she be rejoice in he strength and understanding gloriously that it have only bring he nearer to she after he have be to he room to dress he return to the same chair and settle into the same reverie that be sound depths of he be that he have never suspect he be mutely ask she help ask the support of she frail feminine courage for he masculine courage in the battle before he and little tremor of nervous determination be run through he when he hear he father 's footstep and become conscious of he father 's presence in the doorway there be a moment not of hesitation but of complete a think before he look up and rise to he foot in that moment john wingfield sr have he own shock over the change in the room the muscle of he face twitch in irritation as if he wife 's very frailty be baffling invulnerability straighten he feature into a mask he eye still speak he emotion in a kind of stare of resentment at the picture then he see he son 's shoulder rise above he own and look into he son 's eye to see they smile long isolate by he power from clash of will under the roof of he store or he house the father have a sense of the ripple flash of steel blade a word might start a havoc of whirling burning sentence confuse and stifle as a desert sandstorm or it might bring a single killing flash out of gather cloud thus the two be face each other in a silence oppressive to both which neither know how to break when relief come in the butler 's announcement of dinner indeed by such small objective interruption do dynamic inner impulse hang that this little thing may have suppress the lightning the father be the first to speak he hope that a first day in new york have bring jack a good appetite certainly he could see that the store have give he a wonderful fit for a rush order xxvii by right of ancestry there be to be no story of little river at dinner no question ask about desert life this chapter of jack 's career be a past ring of the ladder to john wingfield sr who be ever look up to the rung above the magnetism and charm with which he win man to he service now turn to the immediate problem of he son whom he be to refashion accord to he idea be you ready to settle down he ask half fearful lest that scene in the drawing-room might have work a change of purpose in answer he be see another jack a jack relax amiable even amenable if you have the patience say jack you know father i have not a cash-register mind i be start out on a new trail and i be likely to go lame at time but i mean to be game he look very frankly and earnestly into he father 's eye wild oats sow my boy after all think the father respect he mother well do not i respect mine of course -- and let he it be good principle it be right he have health that be better than schooling in place of the shock of the son 's will against he he be feel it as a force which might yet act in unison with he he expand with the pride of the fortune-builder he tell how a city within a city be create and run of tentacle of investment and enterprise stretch beyond the store in illimitable ambition how the ball of success once it be set roll gather bulk of its own momentum and ever need closer watch to keep it clear of obstacle and i be to stand on top like a gymnast on a sphere or be roll under think jack and i 'll have cloth of gold breeches and a balance pole tip with jewel but -- but -- a good listener and that be a lot think the father happily jack have interrupted neither with question nor vagary he be gravely attentive marvel over this story of a man 's labor and triumph and the way to learn the business be not from talk by I say he father finally you can not begin at the top no no say jack aghast the top would be quite too insecure too dizzy to start with right the father exclaim decidedly you must learn each department of itself and then how it work in with the other it will be drudgery but it be best -- right at the bottom yes father where there be no danger of a fall you will be put on a apprentice salary of ten dollar a week and i 'll try to earn it of course you understand that the ten be a charge against the store that be business but as for a private allowance you be john wingfield 's son and -- i think i have enough of my own for the present jack put in as you wish but if you need more say the word and you shall name the department where you be to begin do you get any idea of which you would choose from look the store over to-day that be very considerate of you jack answer he be relieved and pleased and make he choice quickly though he mention it half timidly as if he fear that it might be ridiculous so uncertain be he about the rule of apprenticeship you see i have be use to the open air and i would like a little time in which to acclimatize myself in new york now all those big wagon that bring the goods in and the little wagon that take they out -- there be a out-of-door aspect to the delivery service be that a important branch to learn very -- get the goods to the customer -- very then i 'll start with that and sort of a rove commission to look over the other department good we will consider it settle and jack every man 's labor that you can save and retain efficiency -- that be the trick organization and idea that be what make the employer and so make success why jack if you could cut down the work cost in the delivery department or improve the service at the present cost why -- john wingfield sr rub the palm of he hand together delightedly everything be go finely -- so far he add that proviso of _ so far _ instinctively besides jack he go on change to another subject that be equally vital to he ego this name of wingfield be something to work for i be the son of a poor new england clergyman but there be family back of it good blood good blood i be not the first john wingfield and you shall not be the last he rise from the table bidding the servant to bring the coffee to the drawing-room with the same light quick step that he ascend the flight in the store he lead the way downstair he face alive with the dramatic anticipation that it have wear when he take jack out of the office to look down from the balcony of the court ah we have something besides the store jack he be say in the very exultation of the pride of possession as he go to the opposite side of the mantel from the mother 's portrait and turn on the reflector over a picture jack see a buccaneer under the brush of the gold and the shadow of spain a robust ready figure on fight edge who seem to say after you sir and then pardon I but it be you finish sir it be a velasquez jack exclaim and you know that at a glance say he father why yes not many velasqueze in america say the father think incidentally that he son would not have to pay the dealer a heavy toll for a art education while he revel in a surprise that he be evidently hold back or many better velasqueze than this anywhere add jack what mastery what a gift from heaven that be vouchsafe to a human be to paint like that he be in a spell hold no less by the painter 's art than by the subject absolutely a certified velasquez buy from the estate of count galting continue he father i pay a cool two hundred and fifty thousand for it and that be not all jack that be not all that you be go to drudge for as a apprentice in the delivery department i know what i be talk about i be not fool by any of the genealogist who manufacture ancestor i have it all look up by four expert check one off against another yes answer jack absently he have hardly hear he father 's word in fervent scrutiny he be lean forward he weight on the ball of the foot the attitude of the man in the picture and who do you think he be -- who pursue john wingfield sr a man who fight face to face with the enemy a man whom man follow velasquez catch all that answer jack that old fellow be a great man in he day -- a great englishman -- and he name be john wingfield he be you ancestor and mine after a quick breath of awaken comprehension jack take a step nearer the portrait all he faculty in the throe of beam inquiry of señor do not care and desert freedom in the self-same alert readiness of pose as the figure he be face they say i resemble he the father repeat that phrase which he have use in benignant satisfaction to many a guest but now see with greedy eye a likeness between he son and the ancestor deeper than mere resemblance of feature he add : but you -- you jack you be the dead spit of he yes say jack as if he either be not surprised or be too engross to be interested to the buccaneer 's after you sir and then you finish sir he seem to be say in the fully-lived spirit of imagination : a good epitaph sir i 'll see that it be write on you tombstone the father singularly affect by the mutual and enjoy challenge that he be witness half expect to see a sword leap out of the scabbard of the canvas and another from jack 's side if he have live in we day say the father he would have build himself a great place he would have be the head of a great institution just as i be two century be a long way to fetch a comparison answer jack hazily out of a corner of he brain still reserve for conversation while all the rest of it be centered elsewhere he might have be a cow-puncher a revolutionist or a aviator certainly he would never have be a camp-follower at all event a man of power it be in the blood it be in the blood jack repeat with a sort of stare linger emphasis he be hear mary 's protest on the pass she final mysterious reason for send he away she it be not in the blood there could be no connection between this and the ancestor yet in the stir depths of he nature probe the inheritance in he vein she hurt cry have come echo to he ear why i would have pay double the price rather than not have get that picture the father go on there be a good deal of talk about family tree in this town and a strong tendency in some quarter for second generation of wealth to feel a little superiority over the first generation here i come along with a ancestor eight generation back paint by velasquez i tell you it be something of a sensation when i exhibit he in the store you -- you -- and jack glance at he father perplexedly you exhibit he in the store he say why yes as a great velasquez i have just buy i do not advertise he as my ancestor of course still the fact get around yes the fact get around jack while jack study the picture he father study jack whose face and whose manner of blissful challenge to all comer in the unconcern of easy fatality and ready blade seem to grow more and more like that of the first john wingfield at length jack pass over to the other side of the mantel and turn on the reflector over the portrait of he mother and in turn stand silently before she all he militancy be go and in its place come the dreamy softness with which he would watch the eternal painter cloud-rolling on the horizon and he be like she not in feature not in the color of hair or eye but in a peculiar sensitiveness distinguish no less by a fatalism of its own kind than be the cheery aggressiveness of the buccaneer yes father he say that old ruffian forebear of ours could swear and could kill but he have the virtue of truth he could not act or live a lie and i guess something else -- how supremely gentle he could be before a woman like she velasquez bring out a joyous devil and sargent bring out a soul john wingfield sr who stand by the grate be drum nervously on the mantel the drum cease the finger rest rigid and white on the dark wood alive to another manifestation of the lurk force in he son he hasten to change the subject i have almost forget that you always have a taste for art jack yes from she which be hardly change the subject as for the first john wingfield you may be sure that i want to know everything there be to know about the old fellow say the father so i set a lot of bookworm look up the archive of the english and spanish government and digging around in the library after material then i have it all put together in proper shape by a literary sharp you have that cry jack you

under he arm he go upstairs early in the transport of wanderlust that have send he away over the sand from little river _ sí sí _ firio outward bind camp under the star if señor do not care 's desert journey be over -- and he have no thought but that they be -- there be no ban on travel in fancy over sea trail in the ancestor 's company jack be with the buccaneer when he board the enemy at the head of he man with he before the board of admiralty when a young captain of twenty-two he refuse to lie to save he skin with he when in answer to the scolding of elizabeth then a old woman he say :

and woman of he time while he colleague be paint madonna glow with a discoverer 's joy at sight of this fair-haired type of the enemy whom he lead away to he studio more than once be there mention of the fact that this terrible fighter be gentle with woman and fonder of the company of child than of statesman or courtier he have marry the daughter of a great merchant a delicate type of beauty the last to fascinate a buccaneer accord to the gossip of the time rumor have it that he have take she for the wherewithal to pay the enormous debt contract in he latest exploit to disprove this he go to sea in a temper with a frigate and come back laden with the treasure of half a dozen galleon to find that he wife have die at the birth of a son he promise himself to settle down for good but the fog of london choke lung use to soft air he hear the call of the sun and be away again to seek adventure in the broil reach of the caribbean a man of restless wild spirit breathing inconsistency incomprehensible to the convention of whitehall and he son have turn a cromwellian who in poverty seek refuge in america when charle ii come to the throne and from he in the vicissitude of five generation the poor clergyman be descend thus run the tale in its completeness the end of the ancestor 's career have be in keep with its character and course he have be spare the slow decay of faculty in armchair reminiscence he have go down in he ship without strike he color fight the spaniard one to three when jack close the cover on the last page tenderly and in enraptured understanding it be past midnight the spaciousness of the sea under cloud of battle smoke have melt into the spaciousness of the desert under the eternal painter 's canopy then four wall of a bedroom in madison avenue materialize shut out the horizon a carpet in place of sand form the floor and in place of a blanket roll be a canopied bed upon which a servant have lay out a suit of pajamas in the impulse of a desire to look into the face of the first john wingfield in the light of all he now know jack go downstairs and in the silence of the house drink in the portrait again you splendid old devil you he breathe understandingly how should you like to start out deliver goods with I in the morning xxviii jack get a raise the next morning jack go down town with he father in the limousine about a hour later after he have be introduce to the head of the delivery division he be on he way up town beside a driver of one of the wagon on the harlem route he be in the uniform of the wingfield light cavalry have obtain a cap with embroidered initial on the front the driver be like to burst from inward mirth and jack be regard the prospect with veritable juvenile zest at dinner that evening john wingfield jr narrate he experience of the day to john wingfield sr with the simplicity and verisimilitude that always make for both realism and true comedy but jack you take I too literally it be hardly in keep with you position you -- why i think that the only way to know the whole business be to play every part do not you ever deliver package in person in you early day i can not say that i do the father admit wryly then it seem to I that you miss one of the most entertaining and instructive feature jack continue you can not imagine the majestic feminine disdain with which you may be inform that a five-cent bar of soap should be deliver at the back door instead of the front door the most indignant example be a red-haired woman who be do she own work in a flat she fairly blaze she want to know if i do not know what dumb-waiter be for and what do you say the father ask wearily for the ninth john wingfield have a limited sense of humor oh i try however irritate the circumstance to be most courtly for the honor of the store say jack i tell she that i be very sorry and i would speak to you in person about the mistake you mean that you admit who you be oh no the red-haired woman laugh and take the package in at the front door jack respond anybody in little river would have understand just how he look and smile and why it be that the red-haired woman laugh jack -- now really jack this be not quite dignified expostulate the father what do you think you ancestor would say to it i suspect that he would have make a even more ingratiating bow to the lady than i could say jack thoughtfully they have the grand manner better develop in he day than in ours in the ensue week john wingfield sr dwelt in a kind of infernal wonder about he son he be cheer when some friend of he world who have meet jack in the garb of he caste as fit by burleigh would say : fine strapping son you have there wingfield he be abashed and dumfounded when jack announce that he have take mamie devore who sell culinary utensil in the basement out to luncheon with she steady company joe mathewson driver of one of the warehouse truck they be a little awed at first jack explain but they soon become natural i do not know anything pleasanter than make people feel perfectly natural do you you see joe and mamie be very real father and most businesslike a ambitious upstand pair they be go to have two thousand dollar save before they marry ' i do not believe that a woman ought to work out after she be marry ' be the way joe put it and mamie with she eye fairly devour he snap back : ` no she would have enough to do look after you you big old bluff ' mamie be a wiry little thing and joe be a heavyweight with a hand almost as big as a baseball mit that be partly why they practical romance be so fascinating why it be wonderful the story that be play themselves out in that big store father well you see joe be on a stint -- two thousand before he get mamie he have be make money on the side night in boxing bout but mamie stop the fight she say she be not go to have a husband with the tip of he nose drive up between he eye like a bull-dog 's and what do you imagine they be go to do with the two thousand buy a farm be not that cork john wingfield sr shrug he shoulder but do not express he feeling with any remark it seem to he that jack must have be bear without a sense of proportion with the breaking of spring when garden be begin to sprout jack broaden he study to the trail of westchester long island and new jersey course by the big automobile van of the suburban delivery to the people of the store whose street he traverse at will in unremitting wonder over its varied activity he have bring something of the same sensation that he have to a arizona town he come to know the employee by name even as he have he neighbor in little river he nod to the clerk as he pass down a aisle they watch for he come and brighten with he approach and meet he smile with they smile in they idle moment he would stop and talk of the desert although he be learn to like the store as a community of human being its business be as the work of a watch when all he know be how to tell the time by the face but he try hard to learn try until he head be dizzy with a whirl of dissociate fact which he know ought to be associate and under the call of he utter restlessness would disappear altogether for two or three day relieve the pressure it be a safety-valve so i sha not blow up he explain to he father sadly take you time say john wingfield sr have in mind a recent talk with dr bennington jack listen faithfully to he father 's clear-cut lesson he ask question which only make he father sigh for they have little to do with the economy of work cost all he suggestion be extravagant they would contribute to the joy of the employee but not to profit and other question make he father frown in devise answer which be in the nature of explanation bear of he rambling and humanly observant relation with every department they lead into the very heart of thing in that mighty organization there be time when it be hard for he to control he indignation there be trail lead to the room with the glass-paneled door marked private which he half fear to pursue thus between father and son remain that indefinable chasm of thought and habit which filial duty or politeness could not bridge no story of the desert be ever tell at home though it be so easy to tell they to burleigh or mathewson those contrast in a pale fitter of clothes and a herculean rustler of dry-goods box but echo of the tale come to the father through he assistant he have the feeling of some stranger spirit in he own likeness move there in the street of he city under the talisman of a consanguinity that be nominal one day he put a inquiry to the general manager concretely though in a way to avoid the appearance of ask another 's opinion about he own son he have you gift of win man to he there be no deny he popularity with the force say the general manager who be a diplomat the same question be put to peter mortimer we all love he i think a lot of people in the store would march out to the desert after he say mortimer with real rejoice in he candor and courage indeed of late he have be develop cheer as well as courage imbibe both perhaps from the rose in the vase on he employer 's desk jack have order a fresh bunch put there every day and when employee be sick package of grape and bunch of flower come to they in little river fashion with jw on the card as if they have come from the head of the firm himself maybe jack will soften the old man a little run a whisper from basement to roof for the battalion call he jack rather than mr wingfield just as little river have the boy 's good nature be not make he too familiar with the employee be a second question which the father have ask both the general manager and mortimer no that be the surprising thing -- the gift of be friendly without be familiar answer the manager he be get a kind of self-respect that induce respect in other say peter john wingfield sr be the proprietor of the store but the human world of the store begin to feel a kind of proprietorship in jack while its guardian interest in help he in he mistake be common enough to be a conspiracy and the callouse be go from he hand there be no longer a divide line between tan and white on he forehead no outward symbol of the desert cling to he person except the moment of the far vision of distance in he eye superficially on the avenue he would have be take for one of he caste but toss a cowpuncher hat out of a window into broadway be easier than toss a thing out of mind he sit up night to write to mary letter after letter he pour out as a diary of he experience in he new world letter breathe a pupil 's hope of learning and all that pupil 's sorry vagary no answer ever come not even to the most appealing one about he most adventurous conflict with the dinosaur he feel the chagrin of the army of unpublished novelist who lay they heart bare on the stone slab of the dissector in a publisher 's office he might as well have throw all he write into the waste-basket so far as any result be concerned yet he keep on write as if it be he glorious duty to report to she as he superior but he find a more responsive correspondent in jim galway and this be the letter he receive : dear jack : the whole valley be not yet sprout with date as you say it would from you thinking of we maybe we do not use the right seed you ranch be still call jack 's ranch and firio be do he best and about the best i ever know in a indian but as you always say indian be mostly human like the rest of we bar a sort of bear twist in they intellect for which they be not responsible you see jack a lot of you saying still live with we though you be go well firio keep you pd exercise and will not let anybody but himself ride he he say you will need he for you can not budge the stubborn little cuss he declare you be come back when we tell he you be worth twenty million and he be plumb full of primitive foolishness and general ignorance of the outside world he say ' _ sí _ he will come back ' like some heathen oracle that be strong on repetition and weak on vocabulary of course you know about the new addition to we citizenship john prather that double of yours that you do not happen to meet and i might mention that by this time after we have see so much of he we agree with the doge that he do not look a bit like you well he be make a fine ranch across the road from you but hire all he work do which be not exactly accord to little river custom as you will remember the doge set a lot by he though i can not see how there be much in common between they this fellow 's not full of all that kind of scholastic persiflage that you be jack he be so all-fired practical he joint would crack if he be not so oily and he be up to old man leffert ' pretty often he go to phoenix a good deal when i be there the other day i hear he be circulate around among the politician in he quiet way and i see he and pete leddy hobnob together i do not like that but when i tell the doge of it he say he guess there be not much real hobnob the doge be certainly strong for prather another thing i hear be that after all old man leffert ' two partner be not dead and prather 's be hunting they up come to think of it i do not tell you that pete leddy and some of the gang have be back in town of course we have every confidence in the doge he be be so fair to this community still some of we can not help have we private suspicion consider what a lot we have at stake and four or five of we be talk the other night when suddenly we all agree how you would shine in any trouble and if there be go to be any -- not that there be -- we wish you be here well jack the pass have not change and the sunset be just as grand as ever and the air just as free the pass will not have change and the sunset will be do business at the old stand when the antiquary be digging up the remote civilization of little river and put it in a high scale because they run across a pot of mr galway 's jam in the ruin -- the same hifalutin compliment be you own when you be nurse you wound as you will remember here 's wish you luck from the whole town way out here in nowhere as ever yours jame r galway p belvy smith want to know if you will not write just one story i tell she you be too busy for such nonsense now but she refuse to believe it she say be busy do not matter to you she say the story just pop out so i transmit she request jrg pd wait breathe jack no change firio he be like the pass i wonder how wrath of god and jag ear be he write a story for belvy he write to firio in resolute assertion that he would never require the service of pd again when he know that firio despite the protest would still keep pd fit for the trail he write to jim galway how immerse he be in he new career but that he might come for a while -- for a little while with emphasis -- if ever jim wire that he be need that be a good holiday -- a regular week-end debauch away from the shop he think when the letter be finish soon after this come a event which for the first time give john wingfield sr a revelation of the side of he son that have win little river and the interest of the rank and file of the store among jack 's many suggestion in he aim to carry out he father 's talk about the creative business sense the first night they be together have be one for a suburban club delivery system it have be dismiss as fantastic but jack have ask that it be give a trial and he father have consent its basis be a certain confidence in human nature jack and he father have dine together the evening after the master of the push-button have go through the final report of the experiment well jack i be go to raise you salary to a hundred a week the father announce on the ground that if you pay I more i might make myself worth more jack ask respectfully no as a matter of business whenever any man make two dollar for the store he get one dollar and i keep the other that be the basis of my success -- other earn money for I you club scheme be a go as the accountant work it out it have bring a profit of two hundred a week then i have do something worth while really jack ask eagerly but half sceptical of such good fortune yes you have create a value you have use you power of observation and you brain that be the thing that make a few man employer while the multitude remain employee father then i be not quite hopeless hopeless my son hopeless no no i do not expect you to learn the business in a week or a month or even a year time time nor do john wingfield sr wish he son to develop too rapidly now that he be so sure of beat threescore and ten while retain the full possession of he faculty if he follow the rule of longevity he would not have welcome a son who could spring into the saddle at once he want to ride alone he who have never share he power with anyone he who have never admit anyone into even a few share of company partnership in he concern time time the boy would never fall heir to undivided responsibility before he be forty john wingfield sr be please with himself pleased over a good sign and he could not deny that he be please at the sudden change in jack for he see jack 's eye sparkling into he own sparkling with comradeship and spontaneous gratification be the boy to be he in thought and purpose after all yes of course yes inevitably with the approach of maturity gradually the flightiness of he upbringing would wear off down to the steel the hard-tempered paternal steel you can scarcely realize what a fight it have be for I until you know the life i lead out in arizona get strong for you and the store jack begin strong for I for the store yes jack there be a emphasis on the subjective personal pronoun -- for _ he _ for the store the father 's face beam a serene delight this jack accept as the expression of sympathy and understanding which he have crave it be to he a inspiration of fellowship that set the well of he inner be in overflow and the force of he personality which the father have feel uncannily before the mother 's picture become something persuasive in its radiance rather than something hold in leash as a threatening and volcanic element now he could talk as freely and happily of the desert to he father as to burleigh and mathewson he tell of the long ride of firio and wrath of god he make the tinkle of jag ear 's bell hear in the silence of the dining-room as it be hear in the silence of the trail he mention how he be afraid to come back after he be strong afraid query he father yes but i be come -- come when at the top of the pass i see little river for the first time he sketch he meeting with mary ewold the story of the town and the story of jasper ewold as he know it now glance at he father now seem to see nothing except visualization of the picture of he story the father look at the table-cloth at time play with he coffee-spoon make no comment and that first night i see that jasper ewold have meet I somewhere before but -- he go on after go back to the incident of the villa in he childhood -- that hardly explain how could he remember the face of a grown man from the face of a boy jasper ewold do you recall ever have meet he he must have know my mother perhaps he know you though why he should not have tell I i do not know yes yes -- jasper ewold say the father i know he in he younger day he be a old family up in burbridge the new england town where i come from too much college too much travel as i remember characterize jasper ewold no settled point of view and i judge from what you say that he must have run through he patrimony one of the up and downs of the world jack and he never mention that he have meet I no probably a part of that desert notion of freemasonry in keep past a secret but why do you stay on after you have recover from you wound he ask penetratingly though he be look again at the bottom of he coffee-cup for a reason that come to a man but once in he life jack answer have the father look up -- it be a habit of he in listen to any report to lower he eye he face a mask -- he might have see jack 's face in the supremacy of emotion as it be when he have call up to mary from the canyon and when he have plead with she on the pass but john wingfield sr could not mistake the message of a voice vibrate with all the force of a be let free living over the scene with the shadow settle over he eye jack come to she answer and to the finality of she cry : it be not in the blood the only sound be a slight tinkle of a spoon against the coffee-cup look at he father he see a nervous flutter in he cheek he lip hard set he brow draw down and the rigidity of the profile be such that jack be strike by the shiver of a thought that it must have be like he own as other say it be when he have grip pedro nogale 's arm but this pass quickly leave however in its trail a expression of shock and displeasure so it be the girl that keep you -- you be in love john wingfield sr exclaim tensely yes i be -- i be you have it father the unchangeable all of it i face a wall of mystery ` it be not in the blood ' she say as if it be some bar sinister what could she have mean in the fever of baffled intensity cry for light and help he be share the secret that have beset he relentlessly and give he father the supreme confidence of he heart lean across the table he grasp he father 's hand which lay still and unresponsive and singularly cold for a second then john wingfield sr raise he other hand and pat the back of jack 's hesitantly as if uncertain how to deal with this latest situation that have develop out of he son 's old life finally he look up good-temperedly deprecatingly well well jack i almost forget that you be young it be quite a bad case he say but what do she mean can you guess i have think of it so much that it have mean a thousand wild thing jack persist desperately come come the father rally he time time he grip the hand that be grip he and swing it free of the table with a kindly shake all the effective charm of he personality which he never waste the charm that could develop out of the mask to gain a end when the period of listen be over be in play she excite the opposition of the strength in you he say you ask what do she mean it be hard to tell what a woman mean but i judge that she mean that it be not in she blood to marry a fellow who go about fight duel and break arm she would like a more peaceful sort and yes anything that come into she mind leap out and you be mystify by she strange exclamation perhaps i suppose that may be it it be just myself just my devil jack assent limply time time all this will pass jack could not answer that commonplace with one of he own that it would not pass he could only return the pressure when he father rise and come around the table slip he arm about the son in a demonstration of affection which be like open the gate to a new epoch in they relation and you would have kill leddy you could have break that mexican in two i should like to have see that so would the ancestor say the father give jack a hug yes but father that be the horror of it not the power to do it -- no i mean jack that in this world it be well to be strong and you think that i be no longer a weakling jack ask strangely that i carry out you instruction when you send I away oh jack you remember my farewell remark it be make in irritation and suffering that hurt I it hurt my pride and all that my work stand for it hurt I as much as it hurt you but if it be a whip why then it serve a purpose as i want it to yes it be a whip say jack mechanically then all end well -- all quit and jack he swing jack who be unresisting but unresponsive around face he if you ever have any doubt or any question to ask bring they to I will not you yes and jack a hundred a week to-morrow you be all right jack and he give jack a slap on the back as they leave the dining-room xxix a meeting on the avenue trail light sing in the vein and thought of a city light cleansed the street of vapor light the light of the sunshine of late may make a far different new york from the new york under a blanket of march mist of the day of jack 's arrival the lantern of the metropolitan tower be all blaze gold diana 's scarf trail behind she in the shimmering abandon of she _ honus soit qui mal y pense _ chase on olympus admiral farragut grow urbane sailing on a smooth sea with victory win general sherman in he over-brightness guide by he guardian lady still gallantly pursue the tone of time in the direction of the old city hall and trinity and the marble façade of the new library seem no less at home than under a agean sky a ecstasy blind eye to blemish set critical faculty to rejoice over perfection they graciously overlook the blotch of red brick hide the body of st patrick 's on the way up town in gratitude for twin spire against the sky envelop radiance gilded the sharp line of skyscraper and sweep away the shadow in the chasm between they it point the bow of busy tug with spray of diamond fall on the molten surface of river and bay it call up paean of childish treble from tenement alley slip into the sickroom of private house delay the advent of crape on the door and play across the row of bed in the public ward of hospital in the primal democracy of the gift of ozone to the earth the milky glass roof of the central court of the wingfield store act as a screen to the omnipotent visitor but he set unfiltered patch of delight in the aisle and on the counter near the wall mamie devore and burleigh and peter mortimer and many other clerk and employee ask if this be like a desert day and jack say that it be he long to be free of all roof and feel the geniality of the hearth-fire of the planetary system penetrate through he coat he skin he flesh into he very be why not close the store and make a holiday for everybody he ask himself only to be amaze on second thought at such a preposterous suggestion from a hundred-dollar-a-week author of create profit in the business he be almost on the point of act on another impulse which be that he and he father break away into the country in a tour car not know where they be go to stop until hunger overtake a inn this too he dismiss as a milder form of the same demoralizing order of heresy bind to be disturbing to the new filial relation spring from the night when he have tell he desert story over the coffee which contrary to the conventional idea of a exchange of confidence clear the mind of a burden have only provoke more restlessness at least he would fare forth for a while on the broad asphalt trail that begin under the arch of the little park and run to the entrance of the great park even as the desert have its spell of overawing stillness in a uninhabited land so this trail have its spell of congested human movement in the heart of habitation a broad luminous blade lay across the west side of the street and leave the other in shade and all the world that love sunshine and have no errand on the east side keep to the west side there be a communism of inspiration abroad it be a conqueror 's triumph just to be alive and feel the pulse-beat of the throng the very over-developed sensitiveness of city nerve become something to be thankful for in provide the capacity for keener enjoyment as compensation for the capacity for keener pain womankind be in spring plumage the mere consciousness of the value of light to they costume no less than the elixir in they nostril give vivacity to they feature as usual jack be see they only to see mary the creation of no _ couturier _ could bear rivalry with the garb in which he imagination clothe she he find himself suddenly engross in a particular exhibit of fashion 's parade a little distance ahead and go in the same direction as himself a young woman in a simplicity of gown to which she carriage give the final touch of art she step have a long-limbed freedom and lightness with which he own step run in a rhythm to the music of some past association the thrall of a likeness which more and more possess he make he hasten to draw near for a more satisfying glimpse the young woman turn she head to glance into a shop-window and then there could be no mistaking that cheek and chin and the peculiar relation of the long lash to the brow it be the profile whose imprint have become indelible on he mind when he have come round a elbow of rock on galerium the jack of wild tumultuous plead who have part from mary ewold on the pass become a jack elate with the glad swimming joy of may sunshine at see and speak to she again mary mary he cry my but you have become a grand swell he breathe delectably with a fuller vision of she jack there be a nervous twitch of she lip he see she eye at first in a blaze of surprise and wonder then change to the baffling sparkle hide they depths of the sliver of glass on the old barrier he smile and hers in unspoken understanding say that two comrade of another trail have meet on the avenue trail there have not be any leddy there have not be any scene on the pass they be back to the condition of the protocol he have establish when they start out from the porch of the ewold bungalow in the airiest possible mood to look at a parcel of land and you also have become a grand swell she say do you expect that i should be in a gray riding-habit certainly i do not expect to see you in chap and spur it be brittle business but with a common resource in play they manage it well and there they be walk together note by passer-by for they youth and beam oblivion to everything but themselves how long have you be here jack ask two week she answer two week in the same town and this he first glimpse of she what a maze new york be what a desert waste of two week yes we decision to come be rather abrupt she explain a sudden call to travel come to father come to he like a inspiration that he could not resist and how happily he have enter into the spirit of the city again it have make he young and it have be quite like martyrdom for you jack put in teasingly terrible sackcloth and ash i see you be wear the sackcloth she laugh outright with a downward glance at she gown at once in guilt and appreciation another whim of father 's the doge a scapegoat for fashion not a scapegoat -- a partisan he insist on go to one of the best place could i resist i want to see how i feel how i appear the veritable curiosity of a japanese woman get she first foreign gown thank you that be another excuse and it certainly look very well jack declare do you think so mary flush slightly she could not help be please after six year could i drop back into the old chrysali naturally without awkwardness do i still know how to wear a fine gown -- and the gift for it as anyone could see be bear in she as surely as certain gift be bear in jack but she add severely i have only two -- just two and the cost of they it will take the whole orange crop just two when she ought to have twenty when he would have like to put all the pari model in the store in a wagon and himself drive deliver they at she door have succumb to temptation i enjoy it out of sheer respect to the orange crop mary say and yes because i like beautiful gown wickedly truly like they and i like the avenue just as i like the desert and all that she like he could give she and all that he could give she have stubbornly refuse the liveliness of she expression the many shades of mean that she could set caper with a glance be now as the personal reflection of the day and the scene they gait be a saunter one they go as far as the park and start back as if all the time of the desert be theirs they stop to look into the window of shop of every kind from antique to millinery when he see a hat which he declare after deliberate critical appraisement would surely become she she ask boldly if it be better than the one she wear i mean a extra hat that one more hat would have the good fortune of become you almost a real contribution to the literature of compliment she answer unruffled he think too that she ought to have a certain necklace in a jeweler 's window to wear over my riding-habit or when i be digging in the flower bed she inquire when they pass a display of luxury for masculine adornment she find a further retort in suggest that he ought to have a certain giddy fancy waistcoat he compliment she on she taste buy the waistcoat and go to the rear of the shop return wear it with a momentarily appreciate show of jaunty swagger why be on the avenue and not buy he query enthuse with a new idea jim galway should have a cowpuncher hat as a present the style of band be a subject of discussion call on they discriminative view of jim 's personal taste this lead to thought of other in little river who would appreciate gift and to the purchase of toy for the child a positive revel when they be through it be well past noon and they be in the region of the restaurant the sun in majestic altitude sweep the breadth of the avenue shall we lunch -- yes and in the best swell place he ask as if it be a matter-of-course part of the program while inwardly he be stir with the fear of she refusal he feel that any minute she might leave he with no alternative but another farewell she hesitate a moment seriously then accept blithely and naturally yes the best swell place -- let 's who be not entitle to the best swell place occasionally after a argument in comparison of famous name they be convince that they have really choose the best swell place by the fact of a vacant table at a window look out over a box hedge jack tell the waiter that the assemblage be not a autocracy but a parliament which with a full quorum present would enjoy in discursive appreciation selection from the broad range of a bill of fare a luncheon for two narrow a walk on the avenue where you be part of a crowd into restricted intimacy he be feel the intoxication of she inscrutability catch gleam of the wealth that lay beyond it across the limited breadth of a table-cloth he forget about the unspoken condition in a sally which be like put he hand on top of the barrier for a impetuous leap across i write you stack of letter he say and you never send I one little line not even ` yours receive and contents note ' in a flash all intimacy vanish she might have be at the other end of the dining-room in somebody else 's party nod to he as to a acquaintance she answer be delay about as long as it take to lift a arrow from a quiver and notch it in a bowstr a novel may be very interesting but that do not mean that i write to the author he imagine she go through the meal in polite silence or in measure commonplace turn the happy parliament into a frigid gothic ceremony why have he not keep in mind that sufficient to the hour be the pleasure of it famish for she companionship a foolhardy impulse of temptation have risk its loss the waiter set something before they and softly withdraw jack signal the unspoken humility of be a disciplined soldier at attention on he side of the barrier and mary

the wingfield house and halfway to madison avenue they enter a bookstore the light from low window spread across the counter blended with the light from high window at the back and here on a platform at the head of the stair before a big table sit the doge in the majesty of a great patron of literature with a clerk standing by in deftly-urging attentiveness mary and jack pause at the foot of the stair watch he gently he be finger a old octavo finger it as one would who be between the hyperionic desire of possession and a fear that a bank account owe its solvency to keep the amount of deposit somewhere in proportion to the amount of withdrawal no sir no more you tempter he declare no more you unctuous ambassador from the court of gutenberg why this one would take enough alfalfa at the present price a ton to bury you store under a haycock as high as the roman pantheon the doge rise and pick up he broad-brimmed hat prepare to fly from danger he would not expose himself a moment longer to the wiles of that clerk i 'll wait for my daughter down there in the safe and economical environs of the popular novel fresh from the press he say turn to descend the stair he see the wait pair he stop stock still and throw up he hand in a gesture of astonishment he glance hover back and forth between jack 's face and mary 's and then meet jack 's look with something of the same challenge and confidence of he farewell on the road out of little river and in a outburst of genial raillery he begin the conversation where he have leave off with the final call of he personal good wish and he salutation to certain landmark of new york well well sir chap i see sorollum in he new style very different from the academic of the young sorollum he have find he mission and let himself go no wonder people flock to he exhibition on misty day the trouble with we artist be that they be afraid to let themselves go afraid to be popular they think technique be the thing when it be only the tool why confound it all all the great master be popular in they day -- venetian florentine flemish confound it yes and not one velasquez -- evidently he be talk partly to get he bearing after he shock at see jack -- no not one velasquez in the metropolitan i go home without see a velasquez they have the catherine lorillard wolfe collection thousand of square yard of it and yes cheer up thank heaven they have some great american inness and martin and homer and we exile whistler who annex japan and we sargent bear in florence and i do see the metropolitan tower i take off my hat my broad-brimmed hat wish that it be as big as a carter 's umbrella to that tower i hate to think it a accident of chaos like the grand canyon i rather like to think of it as majestic promise the doge have talk so fast that he be almost out of breath he be ready to yield the floor to jack i kiss my hand to diana for you say jack and what do you think the lady in answer shake out she scarf and something white and small flutter down i pick it up it be a note do you open that note ask the doge in haughty suspicion naturally be not it mark personal for I -- this in fine simulation of indignation without address i be chagrin and surprise at diana say the doge ruefully it be the effect of city association as a matter of course she ought to have give it to mercury or at least to one of the centaur consider all the horseshow that have be hold under she skip toe well what do she say be a woman of action she be brief what do she say it be in the nature of a general personal complaint she costume be in need of repair it be flake disgracefully she say that if you have not forsake you love of the plastic for love of the graphic art you would long ago have steal a little gold off the eternal painter 's palette just to clothe she decently for the sake of she own self-respect -- the town have set she so high that its sense of propriety be quite safe i stand convict of neglect say the doge come down to the floor of the store i will shoot she a bundle of gold leaf from the top of the pass on a ray of evening sunshine there he give jack a pat on the shoulder a hasty playful almost affectionate demonstration and break off with a shout of : persiflage sir persiflage it be manna to I declare jack in the fulness and sweetness of the sensation of the atmosphere of little river reproduce in new york and not a velasquez in the metropolitan muse the doge bustling along the aisle hurriedly well mary we have errand to do there be no time to spare they be at the door jack in wistful insistence hungry for they companionship and the doge and mary in common hesitancy for a phrase before parting from he he be ahead of the phrase but there be a velasquez one of the greatest of velasqueze just a few step from here it would take only a minute to see it a velasquez a few step from here cry the doge where be exact before i let my hope rise too high the subject be a ancestor of mine my father have it jack have look in the direction of the wingfield house on the madison avenue corner as he speak and the doge have follow he glance the eagerness pass from the doge 's face but not its intensity that be transmute into something stare and hard a very great velasquez jack repeat my _ amour propre _ the doge say in whisper abstraction use the french which so exactly express the rightness of a inner feeling that will not let one do a thing however much he may wish to then a wave of confusion pass over he face evidently at the echo of he thought in the form of word come unwittingly from he lip he try to retrieve he exclamation in a effort at the forensic : the _ amour propre _ of any american be hurt by the thought that he must go to a private gallery to see a velasquez in the greatest city of the land but it be a lame explanation clearly some old antipathy have be arouse in jasper ewold and it make he hesitate to enter the big red brick house on the corner and we have a wonderful sargent too a sargent of my mother jack proceed yes yes say the doge and eagerness return a strange move eagerness that seem to come from the same depths as the exclamation that have arrest he acceptance of the invitation at the outset it hold the monosyllable like drop of water tremble before they fall i should like you to see they both say jack yes say the doge the word a echo rather than consent there be no one at home at this hour you will have all the time you can spare for the picture in the ascendency of he ardor to retain the joy of they company and in the perplexity of mystery inject afresh into he relation with mary jack be hardly conscious that he urge be only another way of say that he father be absent and mary have not throw she influence either for or against go she be watch she father curiously and penetratingly as if try to understand the source of the emotion that he be seek to control why in that case exclaim the doge why you see he go on to explain we desert folk though we be use to gallery be a little diffident about meet people who live in big mansion i mean people who have not have the desert training that you have have sir chap if it be only a matter of look at a picture without any social responsibility and that picture a velasquez why we must take the time must not we mary yes mary assent with mary on one side of he and jack on the other the doge be walk heavily and slowly at what period of velasquez 's career he ask vacantly when he be young and the subject be middle-aged a northerner with fair hair and lean muscle under a skin bronze by the tropics and the unquenchable fire of youth in he eye that ought to be a good velasquez say the doge at the bottom step of the flight up to the entrance to the house he hesitate he appear to be very old and very tired he face have go quite pale the lid hang heavily over he eye jack drop back in alarm to assist he but he color quickly return and the old challenge be in he glance as it meet jack 's now for you velasquez he exclaim with calm vigor once in the hall jack stand to one side of the door of the drawing-room to let the doge enter first as the old man cross the threshold he hand be clasp behind he he shoulder have fall together not in weariness now but in a kind of dazed studious expectancy and he face the portrait of a lady this be the sargent he say slowly he lip barely open in mechanical and absent comment a good sargent he be as still as the picture in he bow and earnest gaze into she eye except for a occasional nervous movement of the finger all the surroundings seem to melt into a neutral background for the two there be nothing else in the room but the scholar in he age and the portrait of a lady in she youth jack see the doge 's face its many line expressive as through a mist of time its hill and valley in the sun and the shadow of emotion as variable as the mother 's in life speaking personal resentment and wrong admiration and tenderness grievous inquiry and philosophy while the only answer be the radiant i give i give finally the doge tighten the clasp of he hand with a quiver of he frame as he turn toward jack yes a really great sargent -- a sargent of supreme inspiration he say now for you velasquez before the portrait of the first john wingfield jasper ewold 's head and shoulder recover they sturdiness of outline and he feature light with the veritable touch of the brush of genius itself he be the connoisseur who understand whose joy of possession be in the very tingling depths of bear instinct rich with training and ripen by time it be superior to any buy title of ownership in the presence of a supreme standard every shade of discriminative criticism and appraisal become thread weave into a fabric of rapture mary he say he voice have the mellowness of age in its deep appreciation mary wherever you see this -- ski or put in a corner among a thousand other picture in a warehouse a quaker meetinghouse anywhere whatever its surroundings -- should you feel its compelling power should you pause incapable of analysis in a spell of tribute yes i do not think i be quite so insensible as not to realize the greatness of this portrait or that of the sargent either she answer good i be glad mary very glad you do I credit now he turn from the artist to the subject he divine the kind of man the first john wingfield be divine it almost as write in the chronicle which jack keep in he room in hallowed fraternity only he bear hard on the unremitting callous impulsive aggressiveness of a fierce past age with its survival of the fittest swordsman and buccaneer which have no hero for he except the painter poet and thinker it give to posterity fire-eating old devil and the best thing he ever do the best luck he ever have be attract the attention of a young artist it be immortality just to be paint by velasquez the only immortality many a famous man of the time will ever know he look away from the picture to jack 's face keenly and back at the picture and back at jack and back at the picture once more yes yes he muse corroboratively and jack realize that at the same time mary have be make the same comparison very like she say with that impersonal exactness which to he be always the most exasperating of she phase then the doge return to the sargent he be stand nearer the picture but in the same position as before while jack and mary wait silently on he pleasure and all three be as motionless as the furniture have it not be for the nervous twitch of the doge 's finger he seem unconscious of the passing of time a man in a maze of absorption with he thought jack be strangely affect he brain be mark time at the double-quick of fruitless energy he feel the atmosphere of the room surcharge with the hostility of the unknown he be gather a multitude of impression which only contribute more chaos to chaos he sensibility abnormally alive to every sound he hear the outside door open with a latch-key he hear step in the hall and see he father 's figure in the doorway of the drawing-room john wingfield sr appear with a smile that be go in a flash he face go stark and gray as stone under a frown from the doge to jack and with a exclamation of the half-articulate oh of confusion he withdraw jack look around to see the doge half turn in the direction of the door grip the back of a chair to steady himself while mary be regard this sudden change in he in answer to the stricken change in the intruder with some of jack 's own paralysis of wonder the doge be the first to speak he fairly rock the chair as he jerk he hand free of its support while he shake with a palsy which be not that of fear for there be rage color in he cheek the physical power of he great figure be reveal for the first time jack be able to think of he as capable of tower militancy he anger gradually yield to the pressure of will and the situation at length he say faintly with a kind of abyssmal courtesy : thank you sir chap now i shall not go back to the desert without have see a velasquez thank you and we must be go jack have a impulse worthy of the tempestuous buccaneer of the picture to call to he father to come down and then to bar the front door until he burn question be hear the still light in mary 's eye would have check he if not he own proper second thought and the fear of precipitate a ungovernable crisis there have be shadow real shadow he be think wildly they be not bear of desert imagining and out of the quandary of he anguish come only the desire not to part from the doge and mary in this fashion no not until in some way equilibrium of mind be restore though he know that they do not expect or want he company he go out into the street with they he would go as far as they hotel he remark in the bravery of simulated ease the three be walk in the same relative position that they have before with the doge 's bulk hiding mary from jack 's sight the doge set a rapid pace as if under the impetus of a desire to escape from the neighborhood of the wingfield house well sir chap he say after a while it will be a long time before the provincial come to new york again why in this new york you can spend a patrimony in two week -- this with a affected amusement at he own extravagance -- and i have pretty nearly do it so we fly from temptation yes mary we will take the morning train the morning train mary exclaim and she surprise leave no doubt that she father 's decision be new to she be it due to a exchange of glance between a stark face and a face crimson with indignation which jack have already connect with the work out of he own destiny yes that be better than spend we orange crop again she hasten to add with reassuring humor i be fairly homesick for we oasis we have have we fill of the big city say the doge feelingly and we be away to we little city of peace where we turn we past under with the first furrow in the virgin soil then silence the truce of nonsense be dead persiflage be dead jack be as a mute stranger keep at they side unasked while the only glimpse he have of mary be the edge of she hat and she fingertip on she father 's sleeve silence which he feel be as hard for they as for he last until they be at the entrance to the quiet little hotel on a cross-town street where the ewold be stay and have the first glimpse of mary 's eye since they have start he find nothing fathomable in they except unmistakable relief that the walk be over thank you for show I the velasquez say the doge thank you jack mary add both speak in a manner that signal to he the end of all thing but a end which he could not accept i -- i -- oh there be a thousand question i -- he break out desperately the muscle of he face tighten unconsciously he have lean forward toward the doge in he intensity and he attitude have become that of the wingfield of the portrait a lower note of command run through the misery of he tone jasper ewold stare at he in a second of scrutiny at once burningly analytic and reflective then he flush as he have at sight of the figure in the drawing-room doorway he look plainly say : how much longer do you mean to harass I as if jack 's feature be now no less the image of a hard and bitter memory than those of john wingfield sr jack draw back hurt and dumb in face of this anger turn on himself at length the doge muster he rally smile which be that of a man who carry into he decline year a burden of disappointment which he fear may in he bad moment get the better of he personal system of philosophy come mary he say draw he arm through hers he become in a evident effort a grand old-fashioned gentleman make a bow of farewell come mary it be a early train and we have we packing yet to do this time it be indeed dismissal such a dismissal with polite urgency as a venerable cabinet minister might give a importunate caller who be slow to go he and mary start into the hotel but he halt in the doorway to say over he shoulder with something of he old-time cheer which have the same element of pity as he leave-taking on the trail outside of little river : luck sir chap luck mary call in the same strained tone that she have call to jack when he go over the pass on he way to new york the tone that be like the click of a key in the lock of a gate xxx with the phantom as jack leave the hotel entrance he be walk in the treadmill mechanic of a prisoner pacing a cell without note of he surroundings except of dim move figure with which he must avoid collision the phantom of he boyhood bulky and stiflingly near have a monstrous reality yet the ghostly intangibility that mock he sword-thrust of tortured inquiry at length he distraction center on the fact that he and he father be to dine alone that evening they dine alone regularly every Wednesday when jack make a report of he progress and receive a lesson in business it be at the last council of this kind that john wingfield sr have bid he son to bring all question and doubt to he now jack hail the weekly function as have all the promise of relief of a surgeon 's knife fully and candidly he would unburden himself of every question beating in he brain and every doubt assail he spirit by the time that he be mount the step of the house he grow impatience could no longer bear even the delay of wait on dinner when he enter the hall he be the drive creature of a impelling desire that must be satisfied immediately will you ask my father if he will see I at once he say to the butler mr wingfield leave word that he have to go into the country for the night answer the butler i be sorry sir he add confusedly in view of the blank disappointment with which the information be receive in dreary state jack dine by himself in the big dining-room leave the food almost untouch at interval he be rouse to a sense of he presence at table by the servant 's question if he should bring another course without wait for the last one he go downstairs to the drawing-room and standing near the portrait of a lady again pour out he question receive the old answer of i give i give which mean he know that she have give all of herself to he say after say of hers race through he mind without throw light on the mystery which have the uncanniness of a conspiracy against he and after he mother mary have influence he more than any other person she have bring life to the seed which he mother have plant in he nature that new life could not die but without she it could not flourish she cry of it be not in the blood again come echo to he ear what have she mean the question send he to the ewold ' hotel it send this note up to she room : mary : in behalf of old desert comradeship if i be in trouble would not you help I all you could if i be in darkness and you could give I light would you refuse will not you see I for a few moment if i promise to keep to my side of the barrier which you have raise between we i will wait here in the lobby a long time hope that you will jack all the light i have to give i also be in darkness come the answer in a nervous impulsive hand across a sheet of paper and soon mary herself appear from the elevator not in the fashion of the avenue but in simple gray coat and skirt such as she wear at home she greet he in a startled half-fearful manner as if she presence be due to the impulsion of duty rather than choice shall we walk she ask turn toward the door in the welcome of movement as a steadying influence in she evident emotion there they be in the old rhythm of step of little river companionship on a cross-town street he see that the costly hat that he have select for she in the display of a shop-window after all be not the equal of the plain model with a fetch turn to the brim and a single militant feather which she wear that evening the light feather boa around she neck on account of the cool night air seem particularly become he be near very near she so near that they elbow touch but the nearness be like that of a picture out of a frame which have come to life and may step back into cold canvas at any moment oh it be hard in the might of he love for she not to forget everything else and cry out another declaration as he have from the canyon but she face be very still she be wait for he to begin while she finger be play nervously with the tip of she boa i must be frank very frank he say yes jack or why speak at all from the night of my arrival in little river when the doge at once recognize who i be without tell I i see that under he politeness and he kindness he be hostile to my presence in little river yes i think that in a way he be she answer i be conscious that something out of the past be between he and I and that it include you in a subtle influence that nothing could change and this afternoon while you be at the house and my father come to the drawing-room door i could not help notice how the doge be overcome you notice it too yes i never see my father in such anger before it seem to I that he could have strike down that man in the doorway there be a perceptible shudder but she do not look up she glance remain level with the flag and on the pass you say ` it be not in the blood ' he continue yes almost in terror you say it as if it spell a impassable gulf between we why why mary have not i a right to know as he break off passionately with this appeal which be as the focus of all the fear that have torment he they be immediately under the light of a street lamp she turn she head toward he resolutely in the mustering of she force for a ordeal she face be pale but there be a effort at the old smile of comradeship yes as i say the little light that i have be yours jack she begin but there be not much it be perhaps more what i feel than what i know that have influence I all that my father have ever say about you and you father and you relation to we be the night after i return from the pass ahead of you when you have descend into the canyon to frighten I with the risk you be take i do not mean to frighten you he interject i only follow a impulse yes one of you impulse jack she remark comprehendingly father and i have be so much together -- indeed we have never be apart -- that there be more than filial sympathy of feeling between we there be something akin to telepathy we often divine each other 's thought i think that he understand what have take place between we on the pass that you have bring on some sort of a crisis in we relation it be then that he tell I who you be as you know then he talk of you and you father -- you still wish to hear yes and you will listen in silence yes i will grant you defense of you father but you will not argue i be give what you ask in justice to myself i be give my reason my feeling no i will not argue they tone be so low that a passer-by would have hardly be conscious that they be talk but have the passer-by catch the pitch he might have hazard many guess every one serious then i will try to make clear all that father say you be the image of you father -- a smile and a square chin the smile could charm and the chin could kill he like you for some thing that seem to spring from another source as he call it but these would vanish and in the end you would be like you father as he know when he see you break pedro nogale 's arm and you glory in you strength as you tell I on the pass and as i saw for myself in the duel and to you father say victory be the supreme guerdon of life it run triumphant and inextinguishable in you vein i -- he say chokingly but remember he promise not to argue any opposition any refusal excited you will to overcome it in the sheer joy of the exercise of you strength this have be you father 's story in everything even in he marriage she pause there be nothing more no further light on he old relation with my father and mother he ask only a single exclamation ` it be not in the blood for you to believe in jack wingfield mary ' and after that he turn silent and moody i press he for reason he answer that he have tell I enough i have to live my own life the rest i must decide for myself i know that i be hurt he sorely i be striking home into that past about which he would never speak though i know it still cause he many day of suffer but on the desert there be no past jack exclaim yes there be jack there be you own heart on the desert you past be not share with other but to-night after i receive you note i do try for the second time in my life to share father 's i tell he you request i speak of the scene in you drawing-room i ask he what it mean he answer that you must learn from one nearer you than he be and that he never want to think of that scene again it be she who have choose the direction at the street corner they be return now toward the hotel the finger which have be play with the boa have crumple the end of it into a ball which they be grip so tightly that the knuckle be little white spot set in a blood-red background she be suffer but determine to leave nothing unsaid jack when i say ` it be not in the blood ' i be more than repeat my father 's word they express a truth for I i mean not only rebellion against what be in you but against the thing that be in I why jack i do not even remember my own mother i have only hear father speak of she sadly when i be much younger of late year he have not mention she he and the desert and the garden be all i have and all i know and probably yes -- probably i be a strange sort of be but what i be i be and to that i will be true father go to the desert to save my life and broken-hearted old he be greater to I than the sum of any worldly success and jack you forget -- ride over the pass so grandly with you impulse as if to want a thing be to get it -- you -- but we have have good time together and as i say you belong on one side of the pass and i on the other this and much else which one can not see or define be between we from the day you come some forbid influence seem at work in my father 's life and mine and when you have go another man with you feature and you smile come to little river one that i understand even less than you jack recall the reference to the new rancher by bob worther on the day of he departure for the east and later in jim galway 's letter but he do not speak something more compelling than he promise be keep he silent : she own apprehension with its story of phantom of she own and yesterday i see you father 's face she go on as it appear in the doorway for a second before he see my father and be strike with fear and how like yours it be -- but more like john prather 's and the high-sounding preachment about the poverty that might go with fine gown become real to I they be not banal at all they be simple truth free of rhetoric and pretence i know that my cry of ` it be not in the blood ' be as true in I as any impulse of yours ever could be in you to the end under the dominance of she will she have not falter and with the end she look up with a faint smile of stoicism and a invincible flame in she eye anything that he might be able to say would be as flash a blade in and out of a blaze she have become superior to the resource of barrier or armor confident of a self whose richness he realize anew he see and feel the temper fineness of she as something that would mind neither siege nor prayer i be not afraid she say and i know that you be not it be all right then she add with a desperate coolness but still clasp the boa rigidly : the hotel be only a block away and to-morrow you will be back in the store and i shall soon be on my side of the pass this be she right word for a situation when he temple be throb hark back with time 's reversal of condition to a situation after the duel in the _ arroyo _ be over and he have use the right word when she temple be throb and she hand splash if retribution be she object she have repay in nerve-twitch of torture for nerve-twitch of torture the picture that have be alive and out of its frame be back on cold canvas even the girl he have know across the barrier even the girl in armor seem more kindly but one can talk even to a picture in a frame at least jack could with wistful persistence you do not mind if i tell you again -- if i speak my one continuous thought aloud again he ask mary i love you i love you in such a way that i -- with a faint bravery of humor as he see danger signal -- i would build mud-house all day for you to knock to piece foolish business jack she answer or drag a plow very hard work or set out to tunnel a mountain single-handed with hammer and chisel i think you would find it dreadfully monotonous at the end of the first week he have speak he extravagance without win a glance from she she have answer with a precision that be more try than silence _ i _ should not find it so if you be in the neighborhood to welcome I when i knock off for the day he declare you see i can not help it i can not help what be in I just as surely as the breath of life be in I jack she flash back with arrest sharpness but without look around while she step quicken perceptibly suppose i say that i be sorry and i too can not help it that i too have temperament as well as you she tone be almost harsh that even you can not have everything you command that for you to want a thing do not mean that i want it that i can not help the fact that i do not -- with a quick interruption he stay the end of the sentence as if it be a descend blade do not say that he implore it be too much like take a vow that might make you fearfully stubborn in order to live up to it perhaps the thing will come some day it be wonderful how such a thing do come you see i speak from experience he go on in wan insistence with the entrance to the hotel in sight why it be there before you realize it like the morning sunshine in a room while you be yet asleep and you open you eye and there be the joyous wonder settle itself all through you and make itself at home forever you know for the first time that you be alive you know for the first time that you be bear into this world merely because one other person be bear into it very well say she concede in hasty approval without vouchsafe he a glance i begin to think you get more inspiration for compliment on this side of the pass than on the other -- and they be at the hotel door precipitately she hasten through it as if with she last display of strength after the exhaustion of that walk xxxi prather would not wait when he return to the house jack find a letter that have come in the late mail from jim galway : first off that story you send for belvy jim write we have hear it read and reread and the more it be wear with read the fresher it get in we mind as i size up the effect on the population we folk in the forty and fifty get more fun out of it than anybody except the folk in the seventy and the five-to-twelve-year-old some of the thirteen and fourteen-year-old be incline to think at first that it be not quite grow up enough for they until they see what fashionable literature it be become then they dignified maturity limber up a little jack it certainly do we a world of good it seem as if you be back home again back home again jack repeat joyously and then shake he head at himself in solemn warning and those of we that do not take we meat without salt sort of need cheer up jim go on only a few day after i write you the doge and mary suddenly start for new york maybe he have look you up -lrb- the maybe follow a of course which have be scratch through -rrb- and maybe if he have you know more about what be go on here than we do we practically do not know anything but i have sure get a feeling of that uncertainty in the atmosphere that i use to have before a cyclone when i live in kansa this prather that so many think at first look like you have also go to new york he leave only two day ago maybe you will run across he i do not know but it seem to I he be go to get the powder for some kind of a blow-up here jack you know what would happen if we lose we water rights and you know what i write you in my last letter leddy and ropey smith be hang around all the time and since the doge go a whole lot of fellow that do not belong to the honey-bee class have be turn up and put up they tent out on the outskirts like they expect something to happen if thing get worse and i have get something to go on and we need you i be go to telegraph just as i say i would because jack though you be worth a lot of million someway we feel you be one of we very truly yours for little river jame r galway p -- belvy say to put in p because p 's be always the most important part of a letter she want to know if you will not write another story i will say jack i will immediately he make it a long story he take a deal of pain with it in the very relief of something to do when sleep be impossible and he must count the moment in wretched impatience until he interview with the one person who could answer he question as he go down town in the morning the very freshness of the air inspire he with the hope that he should come out of he father 's office with every phantom reduce to a figment of imagination spring from the abnormality of he life-story with a message that should allay mary 's fear and soften she harshness toward he with the certainty that the next time he and he father sit together at dinner it would be in a permanent understanding crave of affection mary might come to new york the doge might spend he decline year in leisurely patronage of bookshop and gallery and he would learn how to run the business though he head split as become a simple normal son these eddy thought on the surface of he mind however could not free he of a consciousness of a deep unsounded current that seem to be the irresistible move power of mary 's future the store 's he father jasper ewold 's and he own with it he be go into a gorge over a cataract or out into pleasant valley he know not which he know nothing except that there be no stop the flood of the current which have its source in stream already flow before he be bear when the last question have be ask he future would be clear relief be ahead and after relief would come the end of introspection and the beginning of he real career but another question be wait for he in the store it be walk the street of he father 's city in the freedom of a spectator who come to observe and not to buy cross the first floor as he come to the court jack see with sudden distinctness among the many face come and go a profile which in its first association develop on he vision as that of he own when he shave in front of the ear in the morning he have only a glimpse before it be turn away and its owner a young man in a quiet gray suit start up the stair jack study the young man 's back half amusedly to see if this too be like he own and laugh at himself because he be sure that he would not know he own back if it be precede he in a promenade up the avenue in peculiar suspense he be hope that the young man would pause and look around as he father always do and shopper often do in a survey of the busy move picture of the whole floor but the young man go on to the top of the flight there he proceed along the railing of the court he profile be again in view under a strong light and jack realize that he first recognition of a resemblance be the recognition of a indisputable fact have i a double out west and another in new york he think it give a man a kind of secondhand feeling then he recall jim 's letter say that john prather have go to new york be this john prather he have no doubt that it be when the object of he scrutiny with full face in view stop and lean over the balcony just above the diamond counter there be a mole patch on the cheek such as jack remember that the account of john prather have mention i be as much fuss as the giant be at the sight of yellow jack muse but for the mole patch the feature be he own as he know they though no one not give to more frequent personal council with mirror than señor do not care of desert trail know quite the light and shadow of he own countenance which give it its character even more than do its form john prather be regard the jewelry display where the diamond be scintillate under the light from the milk glass roof with a smile of amuse contemplation he expression be unpleasant to jack it have a quality of satire and of covetousness as its owner lean farther over the rail and rub the palm of he hand together as gleefully as if the diamond be about to fly into he pocket by enchantment all the time jack have stand motionless in fix and amaze observation he wonder that he stare have not draw the other 's attention but john prather seem too preoccupy with the dazzle of wealth to be susceptible to any telepathic influence great heaven i be gaping at he as if he be climb hand over hand up the face of a sky-scraper jack think it be time something happen why should he get so work up over the fact that another man look like he i 'll get acquaint he declare shake himself free of he antipathy we be both from little river and that be a ready excuse for introduce myself as he start across the floor toward the stair prather straighten from he lean posture for a instant he glance seem to rest on jack indeed eye meet eye for a flash and then prather move away he decision to go might easily have be the electric result of jack 's own decision to join he jack run up the stair at the head of the flight he see at half the distance across the floor prather 's back enter a elevator on the down trip he hurry forward he desire to meet and speak with the man whose influence jim galway and mary fear now overwhelming hello jack sing out and this to prather 's face after he have turn around in the elevator in the second while the elevator man be swing to the door jack and prather be fairly look at each other prather have see that jack want to speak to he even if he have not hear the call he answer be a smile of mixed recognition and satire he make a gesture of appreciative understanding of the distinction in they likeness by touch the mole on he cheek with he finger which be jack 's last glimpse of he before he be shoot down into the lower region of the store he do it neatly jack gasp with a sense of defeat and chagrin and it be plain that he do not care to get acquaint perhaps he take it for grant that i be not friendly and foresee that i would ask he a lot of question about little river that he would not care to answer at all event the only way to accept the situation be lightly he reason insist have hear about the likeness possibly he come to the store to have a look at I and after see I feel that he have be libel but he feeling refuse to follow he reason in a amuse view i do not like john prather he conclude as he take the next elevator to the top floor yes i like pete leddy better at we first meeting i have rather a man would swear at I than smile in that fashion it be much more simple the incident have have such a besetting and disagreeable effect that jack would have find it difficult to rid he mind of it if he have not have a more center and press object in prospect in the citadel of the push-button behind the glass marked private john wingfield sr look up from he desk in covert watchfulness to detect he son 's mood and he be conscious of a quality of manner that recall the return exile 's entry into the same room upon he arrival from the west well jack the father say with marked cheeriness i hear you have be take a holiday it be all right and you will find motoring beat pony ride in some way jack answer and then he come a step nearer he hand rest on the edge of the desk as he look into he father 's eye with glowing candor john wingfield sr 's eye shift to the pushbutton and later to a paper on the desk with which he finger play gently he realize instantly that something unusual be on jack 's mind father jack go on i want a long talk quite alone with you when it be over i feel that we shall both know each other better we can work together in a fuller understanding yes jack answer the father cautiously feel he way with a swift upward glance which fall again to the paper well what be it now come on there be a lot of question i want to ask -- family question family question the finger pause in play with the paper for a instant and go on play again the soft hand be as white as the paper family question eh well there be not much to we family except you and i and that old ancestor -- and a long talk you say yes i think that probably this would be a good time you could give I a hour now it might not take that long jack 's voice be even and engage and respectful but it seem to fill the room with many echo whisper i have a very busy day before I the father say still without look up he be talk to a little pad at one corner of the green blotter which have a list of he appointment you question be not so imperative that they can not wait then shall it be at dinner jack ask at dinner no i have a engagement for dinner shall you be home early shall i wait up for you jack persist yes that be it say at nine i 'll make a point of it -- in the library at nine john wingfield sr 's hand slip away from the papers and pat the back of jack 's hand and come on with you question i will answer every one that i can he be look up at jack now smilingly and attractively in he frankness every one that i can from the first john wingfield right down to the present but the hand that lay on jack 's be cold and its movement nervous and spasmodic thank you father i know you would i have not forget you wish that i should bring all my doubt and question to you say jack happily and in a impulse which have the devoutness of a rise hope he take that cold soft hand in both of he and give it a shake and the feel of the son 's grip firm and warm remain with john wingfield sr while he stare at the door through which jack have pass out when he have pull himself together he ask mortimer to connect he with dr bennington doctor i want a little talk with you to-night before nine he say could you dine with I -- not at the house -- say at the club yes -- excellent -- and make it at seven yes good-by xxxii a crisis in the wingfield library a library atmosphere be miss from the wingfield library with its heavy panelling and row of red and blue morocco back rather the suggestion be of a bastion of privacy where a man of action might make he plan or take counsel at leisure amid rich and mellow surroundings here john wingfield sr have gain point through post-prandial geniality which he could never have win in the presence of the battery of push-button here he most successful conception have come to he here he have know the greatest moment of he life he be right in say that he love he library but he hardly love it for its book when he return to the house shortly before nine from he session with dr bennington it be with the knowledge that another great moment be in prospect he take a few turn up and down the room before he ring for the butler to tell jack that he have come in then he place a chair near the desk where its occupant would sit face he after he sit down he move the desk lamp which be the only light in the room so that its ray fall on the back of the chair and leave he own face in shadow -- a precaution which he have take on many other occasion in adroitness of stage management he draw from the humidor drawer of he desk a box of the long cigar with blunt end which need no encircle gilt band in praise of they quality as jack enter the father welcome he with a warm paternal smile and be it remember that john wingfield sr could smile most pleasantly and he know the value of he smile jack answer the smile with one of he own a little wan a little subdue yet enliven under the glow of he father 's evident happiness at see he the father who have transgress the rule of longevity by take a second cigar after dinner now push the box across the desk to he son jack say that he would roll one he do not care to smoke much he produce a small package of flake tobacco and a packet of rice paper and with a deftness that be like sleight of hand make a cigarette without spilling a single flake he have not always choose the makings in place of private stock havana but it seem to suit he mood to-night that be one of the thing you learn in the west the father observe affably to break the ice i can do they with one hand jack answer but you be likely to have a overflow -- which be all right when you have the whole desert for the litter besides in a library it would have the effect of gallery play i fear he be seat in a way that reveal all the supple line of he figure however relax he attitude before he father it be always suggestive of latent strength appeal at once to paternal pride and paternal uncertainty as to what course the strength would take he face under the light of the lamp be boyish and singularly without trace of guile the father strike a match and hold it to light he son 's cigarette another habit of he which he have find flattering to man who be bring into the library for conference jack take a puff slowly and after a time another puff and then drop the cigarette on the ash receiver as much as to say that he have smoke enough something tell john wingfield sr that this be to be a long interview and in no way hurry as he see the smile die on the son 's lip and misery come into the son 's eye these last two day have be pretty poignant for I jack begin in a simple outright fashion and only half a hour ago i get this it be hard to resist take the first train west he draw a telegram from he pocket and hand it to he father we want you and though we do not suppose you can come we simply have to let you know jame r galway it be greek to I say the father from you little river friend i judge yes i suppose that we may as well begin with it as it drive everything else out of my mind for the moment john wingfield sr swing around in he chair with he face in the shadow he attitude be that of a companionable listener who be prepare for any kind of news as you will jack he say everything that pertain to you be my interest go ahead in you own way it concern john prather i do not know that i have ever tell you about he in my talk of little river john prather the father reflectively sound the name the while he study the spiral of smoke rise from he cigar no i do not think you have mention he it be jack 's purpose to take he father entirely into he confidence to reveal he own mind so that there should be nothing of its perplexity which he father do not understand he might not choose a logical sequence of thought or event but in the end nothing should be leave untold indeed he have not study how to begin he inquiry that he have leave to take care of itself he chief solicitude be to keep he mind open and free of bitterness whatever transpire and it be evident that he be under a great strain he tell of the come of john prather to little river while he be absent of the mention of the likeness by he fellow-rancher and of the fear entertain by jim galway and mary when he come to the scene in the store that afternoon it be give in a transparent fulness of detail while all he change emotion from he first glimpse of prather 's profile to the effort to speak with he and the ultimatum of prather 's satirical gesture be reflect in he feature he be the story-teller put he gift to a unpleasant task in illumination of sober fact and not the use of imagination and he audience be he father 's cheek and ear in the shadow extraordinary john wingfield sr exclaim when jack have finish glance around with a shrug naturally you be irritated i like to think that only two man have the wingfield feature -- the feature of the ancestor -- yes only two : you and i it be more than irritation it be something profound and disturbing almost revolting jack exclaim under the disagreeable spell of he vivid recollection of the incident the resemblance to you be so striking father especially in the profile jack be lean forward the better to see he father 's profile dim in the half light yes recognizable instantly -- the nose and the line about the mouth you have never meet anyone who have see this man you have never hear of he he ask almost morbidly john wingfield sr break into a laugh which be deprecatory and metallic he look fairly into jack 's eye with a kind of inquire amazement at the boy 's overwrought intensity why no jack he say reassuringly if i have i should not have forget it you may be sure and well jack there be no use of be sensitive about it though i understand you indignation -- especially after he flaunt the fact of the resemblance in such a manner and refuse to meet you from what i have hear about that fight with leddy -- dr bennington tell I -- i can appreciate why he do not care to meet you he laugh more genially this time in the survey of he son 's broad shoulder i fear there be something of the old ancestor 's devil in you when you get go he add so he father have see this too -- what mary have see -- this thing bear in he with the come of he strength yes i suppose there be he admit ruefully yes i have reason to know that there be he face go moody any malice toward john prather pass he be penitent for a feeling against a stranger that seem akin to the dormant instinct that have make he glory in hold a bead on pete leddy and i be glad of it say john wingfield sr with a flash of stronger emotion than he have yet show in the interview i be not it make I almost afraid of myself jack answer oh i do not mean firing six-shooter -- hardly i mean backbone he hasten to add almost ingratiatingly it be a thing to control jack not to worry about yes to control say jack dismally he be hear ignacio 's cry of the devil be out of señor do not care and see for the thousandth time mary 's horrify face as he press pedro nogale against the hedge now poise be all on the side of the father who glance away from jack at the glint of the library case in the semi-darkness in satisfaction but only a moment do the son 's absent mood last he lean forward quiver free from he spell of reflection and he word come pelt like hail he be at grip with the phantom and nothing should loosen he hold till the truth be out father i could not fail to see the look on you face and the look on jasper ewold 's when you find he in the drawing-room at the sudden reversal of he son 's attitude john wingfield sr have draw back into the shadow as if in defensive instinct before the force that be beat in jack 's voice yes i be startle yes very startled but go on speak everything that you have in mind for it be evident that you have much to say go on he repeat more calmly and turn he face farther into the shadow while he incline he head toward jack as if to hear better one leg have draw up under he and be press against the chair jack wait a moment to gather he thought when he speak he passion be go we have always be as stranger father he begin i have no recollection of you in childhood until that day you come as a stranger to the house at versaille i be seven then my mother be away as you will recall i remember that you do not kiss I or show any affection you do not even say who you be you look I over and i be very frail i see that i do not please you and i do not like you in my childish perversity i would speak only french to you which you do not understand when my mother come home do you remember she look i do she go white as chalk and tremble i be frighten with the thought that she be go to die it be a little while before she speak and when she do speak she be like stone she ask you what you want as if you be a intruder you say : ' i have be look at the boy ' you expression tell I again that you be not please with I without another word you depart i can still hear you step on the walk as you go away they be so very firm yes jack i can never forget the tone be that of a man rack what else he ask go on jack you know the life my mother and i lead study and play together and that be the only time you see I until i be fourteen i be mortally in awe of you then and in awe of you the day i go west with you message to get strong but i get strong yes strong father yes jack say the father yes jack leave nothing unsaid -- nothing now jack sweep back to the villa garden in florence the day of the doge 's call and from there to the doge 's glance of recognition that first night in little river then to the scene in front of the bookstore when the doge hesitate about go to see the velasquez he picture the doge 's absorption over the mother 's portrait he repeat mary 's story on the previous evening all the while the profile so dimly outline in the outer darkness beyond the lamp 's circle of light to which he have be speak have not stir the father 's cigar have go out it lay idly in he finger which rest on the arm of the chair above a tiny pile of ash on the rug but there be no other sign of emotion except he half affirmative interjection with a confessional 's encouragement to empty the mind of its every affliction why be my mother and myself always in exile what be this barrier between you and she why be it that i never see you why this bitterness of jasper ewold against you why should that bitterness be turn against I i want to know father so that we can start afresh and right i no longer want to be in the dark with its mystery but in the light where i can grapple with the truth there be no rancor no crash of sentence only high tension in the finality of a inquiry in which hope and fear rise together yes jack exclaim john wingfield sr after a silence in which he seem to be pass all that jack have say in review i be glad you have tell I this that you have come to the one to whom you should come in trouble you have make it possible for I to speak of something that i never find a way to speak about myself for jack you truly have be a stranger to I and i to you thanks to the chain of influence which you have mention very slowly john wingfield sr have turn in he chair distress be rise in he tone as he lean toward jack he face under the rim of light of the lamp have a new charm which be not that of the indulgent or flattering or win smile or the masterful set of he chin on a object he seem pallid and old struggle against a phantom himself almost pitiful this man of strength while he eye look into jack 's with limpid candor jack i will tell you all i can he say i want to it be duty it be relief but first will you tell I what you mother tell you what she reason be i have a right to know that have not i in my effort to make my side clear he speak in direct intimate appeal jack 's lip be tremble and he whole nature be throb in a new-found sympathy for the first time he see he father as a man of sensitive feeling capable of deep suffering and he be to have the truth all the truth in kindness and affection after you have leave the house at versaille say jack she take I in she arm and say that you be my father ` do you like he ' she ask and i say no realize nothing but the childish impression of the interview at that she be wildly almost hysterically triumphant i be glad to have make she so happy ` you be mine alone you have only I ' she declare over and over again ` and you must never ask I any question for that be best ' she never mention you afterward and in all my life until i be fourteen i be never away from she again the palm of john wingfield sr 's hand run back and forth over he knee and the foot that be against the chair leg beat a nervous tattoo while he draw a longer breath than usual which might have be either of surprise or relief he face fall back behind the rim of the lamp 's ray but he do not turn it away as he have when jack be talk you know only the jasper ewold who have be mellow by time he begin he scholarship be a bond of companionship for you in the isolation of a small community i know he as boy and young man he be very precocious at the age of eight as i remember he could read he caesar you will appreciate what that mean in a new england town -- that he be somewhat spoil by admiration and naturally he character and mine be very different thanks to the difference in we situation for the ewold have a good deal of money in those day i be the type of boy who be ready to work at any kind of odd job in order to get dime and quarter for my little bank well it be quite absurd to go back to that as the beginning of jasper ewold 's feeling toward I but one day young wingfield feel that young ewold be patronize he we have a turn at fisticuffs which result in my favor jasper be a proud boy and he never quite forgive I in fact he be not use to be cross learning be easy for he he be good-looking he have a attractive manner and it seem only he right that all door should open when he knock soon after we battle he go away to school not until we be well past thirty do we path cross again he be something of a painter but he really have have no set purpose in life except the pleasure of he intellectual diversion i will not say that he be wild but at least he have live in the abundant freedom of he opportunity he fall in love at the same time that i do with alice jamison you have see you mother 's picture but that give you little idea of she beauty in girlhood i have always think she beautiful jack exclaim spontaneously yes i be glad she always be beautiful to I but i like best to think of she before she turn against I i like to think of she as she be in the day of we courtship fortune favor I instead of jasper ewold i can well understand the blow it be to he that she should take the storekeeper the man without learn the man without family as people suppose then when he think that she belong entirely to he world but he enmity thereafter i can only explain by he wounded pride by a mortal defeat for one use to have he way for one who have never know discipline you mother and i be very happy for a time i think that she love I and have choose I because i be a man of purpose while jasper ewold be not john wingfield sr speak deliberately measure he thought before he put it into word as if he be try to set himself apart as one figure in a drama while he aim to do exact justice to the other it be soon after you be bear that you mother 's attitude change she be as you know supersensitive and whatever she grievance be she keep they to herself my immersion in my affair be such that i could not be as attentive to she as i ought to have be sometimes i think that the advertisement with we name in big letter in every morning paper might be offensive to she again that she miss in I the education i have have to forfeit in youth and that my affection could hardly take its place i know that jasper ewold see she occasionally and in he impulse i know that he say thing about I that be untrue but that i pass over in he place i too might have be bitter the best explanation i can find of you mother 's change toward I be one that belong in the domain of psychology and pathology she suffer a great deal at you birth and she never regain she former strength when she rise from she bed it be with a shadow over she mind i see that she be unhappy and nervous in my presence indeed i have at time to face the awful sensation of feeling that i be actually repugnant to she she be especially irritable if i kissed or fondle you she drop all she friend she never make call she refuse to see caller i consult specialist and all the satisfaction i have be that she be of a peculiarly high-strung nature and that in certain phase of melancholia where there be no complete mental and physical breakdown the patient turn on the one whom she would hold nearest and dearest if she be normal the child that have take she strength become the virtual passion of she worship which she would share with no one when she propose to go to europe for a rest take you with she i welcome the idea i rejoice in the hope that the doctor hold out that she would come back well and i venture to believe in a happy future with you as we common object of love and care but she never return as you know and she only write I once a wild sort of letter about what a beautiful boy you be and that she have you and i have the store and i be never to send she any more remittance i make a number of trip to europe i could not go frequently because in those day jack i be a heavy borrower of money in the expansion of my business and only one who have build up a great business can understand how in the earlier and more uncertain period of we banking credit the absence of personal attention in any sudden crisis might throw you on the rock naturally when i go i write to alice that i be come but i always find that she have go and leave no address for forwarding mail from the crédit lyonnai once when i go without write she elude I and the second time i find that she have a cottage at versaille that as you know be the only occasion when i ever see you or she until i come to bring you home after she sudden death yes jack whisper starkly that day i have leave she as well as usual and come home to find she lie still and white on a couch she book fall out of she hand onto the floor and -- the word choke in he throat and the stranger you father who come for you seem very hard and forbid to you yes jack manage to say but jack when my step sound so firm the day i leave you at versaille it be the firmness of force of will fight to accept the inevitable for i have see you face it be like mine and yet i have to give you up i have to give you up know that i might not see you again know that this tragic incomprehensible fatality have set you against I know that any further effort to see you mean only pain for alice and for I whatever happiness she know come from you and that she should have and remember jack that out of all this tragedy i too have my point of view i have my moment of reproach against fate my moment of bitterness and anger my moment when i set all my mind with volcanic energy into my affair in order to forget my misfortune i have to build for the sake of building perhaps that harden I when you come home i see that you be mine in blood but not mine in heart all you training have be foreign all of estrangement from the business and the way of the home-country which you could not help i could not help nothing now could help but after all i have be build for you that be my new solace i want you to be equal to what be come to you and that change mean discipline to be frank with you as you have be with I you be sickly hectic dreamy and when word come that you must go to the desert if you life be to be save -- well jack i have to put affection aside and consider this blow for what it be and think not of kind word but of what be best for you and you future i know that my duty to you and you duty to yourself be to see you become strong and for you sake you must not return until you be strong now as for the scene in the drawing-room the other day : i could not forget what jasper ewold have say of I that be one thing another be that i have detect he influence over you a influence against the purpose and steadiness that i be try to inculcate in you and suddenly come upon he in my own house in view of he enmity and the way in which he have speak about I i be naturally startle and indignant and withdraw to avoid a scene that be all jack i have answer you question to the best of my knowledge if other occur to you i will try my best to answer they too and the father seem ready to submit every recess of he mind to the son 's inquisition you have answer everything say jack everything -- fairly considerately generously there be a flash of triumph in the father 's eye slowly he rise and stand with he finger-end caress the blotting-pad jack rise at the same time he movement automatic instinctively in sympathy with he father 's he head be bow under stress of the emotion incapable of translation into language which transfix he it have all be make clear this thing that no one could help he feeling toward he mother could never change but penetrate to the depths in which it have be hold sacred be a new feeling the pain that have bring he into the world have bring misery to the author of he be there be no phantom except the breath of life in he nostril which they have give he watchfully respect the son 's silence the father 's lip tighten he chin go out slightly and he brow draw together in a way that indicate that he do not consider the battle over at length jack 's head come up and he face have the strength of a youthful replica of the ancestor 's radiant in gratitude and in he eye for the first time in look into he father 's be trust and affection there be no word no other demonstration except the steady liquid look that speak the birth of a great understanding comradeship the father feed he hunger for possession which have be irresistibly grow in he for the last two month on that look he see he son 's strength as something that have at last become malleable and this be the moment when the metal be at white heat ready for know turn with the pincers and know blow of the hammer the message from jim galway be still on the table where the father have lay it after read now he press he finger on it so hard that the nail become a row of red spot and the telegram jack he ask jack stare at the yellow slip of paper as the symbol of problem that reappear with burn acuteness in he mind it smile at he in the satire of john prather triumphing in little river it visualize picture of lean rancher who have bring he flower in the day of he convalescence of child gather around he on the step of he bungalow of all the friendly face brim good-will into he own on the day of he departure of a patch of green in desert loneliness with a summons to arm to defend its artery of life they want I to help -- i half promise he say yes and just how can you help ask he father gently why that be not quite clear yet but a stranger they make I one of themselves they say that they need I and father that thrill I it thrill the idler to find that there be some place where he could be of service that there be some one definite thing that other think he could do well the father proceed cautiously reasonably with he question as one who seek for light for its own sake jack 's answer be luminously frank for there be always to be truth between they in they new fellowship unfettered by hope or vagary you could help with you knowledge of law with political influence help these man seasoned by experience in land dispute in that region no and would jasper ewold whom i understand be the head and founder of the community want you to come have he ask you the father continue draw in the web of logic on the contrary he would not want I and miss ewold would she want you there jack hesitate when he speak however it be to admit the fact that be stab he no she would not she have dismiss I but -- but i half promise he add he feature set firmly as they have after leddy have fire at he it seem like duty unavoidable the metal be cool lose its malleability and the father proceed to thrust it back into the furnace then i take it that you value to little river be you cool hand with a gun he say and the summons be to uncertainty which may lead to something worse than a duel you be ask to come because you can fight do you want to go for that to go to let the devil as you call it out of you now the metal be soft with the heat of the shame of the moment when jack have call to leddy i be go to kill you and of the moment when he see pedro nogale 's limp broken arm and ghastly face no no jack gasp i want no fight i never want to draw a bead on a man again i never want to have a revolver in my hand again he be shudder half lean against the desk for support he father wait in observant comprehension convulsively jack straighten with desperation and all the impassioned plead to mary on the pass be in he eye but the thing that i can not help -- the transcendent thing not of logic not of little river ' difficulty -- how be i to give that up he cry miss ewold you mean yes jack i know i understand who should understand if not i the father draw jack 's hand into he own and the fluid force of he desire for mastery be flow out from he finger-end into the son 's fiber which be receptively sensitive to the caress i know what it be when the woman you love dismiss you you have she to think of as well as yourself you own wish may not be lord you may not win that which will not be win -- how well he know that -- either by protest by persistence or by labor you be deal with the tender and intangible with feminine temperament jack and jack it be wise for you be not it to bear in mind that you life have not be normal with the switch from desert to city life homesickness have creep over you from to-night thing will not be so strange will they but if you wish a change go to europe -- yes go though i can not bear to think of lose you the very moment that we have come to know each other when the past be clear and amends be at hand and jack if you mother be here with we and be herself would she want you to go back to take up a rifle instead of you work at my side i do not pretend to understand jasper ewold 's or mary ewold 's thought she have prefer to make another generation 's ill-feeling she own in a thing that concern she life alone she have see enough of you to know she mind for from all i hear you have not be a faint-hearted lover be it fair to she to follow she back to the desert be it the courage of self-denial of control of impulse on you part would you mother want you to persist in a veritable conquest by force of you will whose strength you hardly realize against mary ewold 's sensibility and if you break down she will if you win would there be happiness for you and for she jack wait if she care for you if there be any germ of love for you in she it will grow of itself you can not force it into blossom come jack be i not right jack 's hand lay cold and limp in he father 's so limp that it seem only a case of lead now yet there be always the uncertain in the boy the uncertain hover under that face of ash that the father be so keenly watch a face so clearly reveal the throe of a struggle that send cold little shiver into he father 's warm grasp jack 's eye be look into the distance through a mist he drop the lid as if he want darkness in which to think when he raise they it be to look in he father 's eye firmly there be a half sob as if this sentimentalist this señor do not care have wring determination from a precipice edge even as mary ewold have he grip he father 's hand strongly and lift they on a level with he breast you have be very fine father i want you to be patient and go on help I the trail be a rough one but straight now i -- i be too brimming full to talk and blindly he leave the library when the door close john wingfield sr seize the telegram roll it up with a glad fierce energy and throw it into the waste-basket he head go up he eye become point of sharp flame he lip part in a smile of relief and triumph and come together in a straight line before he sink down in he chair in a collapse of exhaustion after a while he have the decanter bring in he gulp a glass of brandy light another cigar and swing around fall back at ease he mind a blank except for one glowing thought : he will not go he will give up the girl he be to be all mine it be say that the best actor never go on the stage they play real part in private life make they own line as they watch the other player one of this company survey the glint of he bookcase be satisfy with the greatest effort of he life in he library xxxiii prather see the portrait it do not occur to jack to question a word of the narrative that have reduce a dismal enigma to luminous connected fact with the swift process of reason and the promptness of decision of which he be capable on occasion he have make up he mind as to he future even as he ascend the stair to he room the poignancy of he father 's appeal have strike to the bed-rock of he affection and he conscience reveal duty not as a thing that you set for yourself but which circumstance set for you never before have he realize how hopelessly he have be a dreamer firio pd wrath of god and jag ear become the fantastic memory of another incarnation he devil should never again rejoice in have he finger on a trigger or send he off a easy traveller in search of gorgeous sunrise he devil should be transform into a backbone of unremitting apprenticeship in loving service for the father who have build for he in love though he head split he would master every detail of the business and when jack step into the rubicon he do not splash around or look back he go right over to the new country on the other bank but there be certain person whom he must inform of the cross first he write a telegram to jim galway : sorry but overwhelming duty here will not permit luck and my prayer with you then to firio a letter which do not come quite so easily : you see by now that you be mistaken firio i be not come back make the most of the ranch -- you ranch -- that you can the brevity he tell himself be in keep with firio 's own style besides anything more at length would have open up a avenue of recollection which properly belong to oblivion and mary yes he would write to she too he would cut the last strand with the west that be best that be the part of he new courage of self-denial strip itself of every trammeling association of sentiment other man have give up the woman of they choice and he could never be the man of this woman 's choice somehow he father 's talk have make he realize a inevitable outcome which have better be meet and master in present fortitude rather than after prolonged year of fruitless hope center two thousand mile away he start a dozen letter to mary mean each to be a fitting _ envoi _ to they comradeship and a song of good wish each one he write in the haste of have the task quickly over only to throw away what he have write when he read it the touch that he want would not come he be simply flash out a few of a thousand disconnect thought that run away incoherently with he pen but be not any letter any communication of any kind superfluous be not it the folly of weak and stupid stubbornness she have speak she final word in they relation at the hotel door there be no little river there be no mary there be nothing but the store to enforce this fiat he have only to send the wire to jim and post the letter to firio this he would do himself a stroll would give he fresh air it be just what he need after all he have be through that evening and he would see the street not with any memory of the old restlessness when he and he father be stranger but kindly as the symbol of the future he room be on the second floor as he leave it he hear the door-bell ring its electric titter very clear in the silence of the house no doubt it mean a telegram for he father at the turn of the stair on the first floor he see the back of the butler before the open door evidently it be not a matter of a telegram but of some late caller jack pause in the darkness of the landing partly to avoid the bother of have to meet anyone and partly arrest by the manner of the butler who seem to be startle and in doubt about admit a stranger at that hour indistinctly jack could hear the caller 's voice the tone be familiar in a peculiar quality which he try to associate with a voice that he have hear frequently the butler apparently satisfy with the caller 's appearance or at least with he own ability to take care of a single intruder step back with a word to come in then out of the obscurity of the vestibule appear the pale face of john prather jack withdraw farther into the shadow instinctively as if he have see a ghost as if indeed he be in fear of ghost i will take you card to mr wingfield say the butler prather make a perfunctory movement as if for a card-case but apparently change he mind under the prompt suggestion that it be superfluous my name be john prather he announce mr wingfield know who i be and i be quite sure that he will see I while the butler after rap cautiously go into the library with the message john prather stand half smile to himself as he look around the hall the effect seem to please he in a contemplative fashion for he rub the palm of he hand together as he have in he survey of the diamond counter he be serenity itself as john wingfield sr burst out of the library he face hard-set i think you be go this evening he exclaim by what right do you come here he place himself directly in front of prather thus hide prather 's figure but not he face which jack could see be not in the least disturb by the other 's temper oh no the early morning train have the connection i want for arizona he answer casually as if he be far from be in any hurry i be take a walk and happen to turn into madison avenue i find myself in front of the house it occur to I what a lot i have hear about that ancestor and see a light in the library and consider how late it be i think i might have a glimpse of he without inconvenience any other member of the family do you mind he put the question with a inflection that be at once engage and confident mind gasp john wingfield sr i be sure you do not prather return now a certain deference and a certain pungency of satire run together in he tone the mixture be nicely and pleasurably control be it in there in the drawing-room and then what else where do you mean to end i think that -- nothing else prather interrupted reassuringly everything be settle of course this be sort of a farewell privilege yes in there snap john wingfield sr it be the picture on the other side of the mantel i will wait here -- and be quick quick i tell you i want you out of this house i have do enough i -- thanks it be very good-natured of you john prather pass leisurely into the drawing-room and john wingfield sr stand guard by the door he hand grip the heavy portiere for support while he gaze be steadily fix at a point in the turn of the stair just below where jack be obscure in the shadow he face be draw and ashen against the deep red of the hanging and torment and fear and defiance now one and then the other be in ascendency over the feature which jack have always associate with compose and unchanging mastery until he have see they illumined with affection only a hour before and the father have say that he have never meet or hear of john prather the father have say so quietly decidedly without hesitation this one thought keep repeat itself to jack 's stunned brain as he lean against the wall limp from a blow that admit of no aggressive return the ancestor certainly must have be a snappy member of society in he time it have be delightful to have a look at he say john prather as he come out of the drawing-room he pause as he speak he be still smile the mole on he cheek be toward the stairway and it seem to heighten the satire of he smile the face of the young man and the old man be close together and they be stand in much the same attitude give a effect of likeness in more than physiognomy that note of john prather 's voice that have sound so familiar to jack be a note in the father 's voice when he be particularly suave this be the end -- that be the understanding -- the end demand john wingfield sr oh quite john prather answer easily move toward the door he do not offer he hand nor do john wingfield sr offer to take it but as he go out he say he smile broaden : i hope that jack make a success with the store though he never could run it as well as i could good-by good-by gasp john wingfield sr he wheel around distractedly and stand still he head bow he finger work nervously before he hand part in a shrug outspread gesture of relief then he head rise he body stiffen once more he arbitrary self he start up the stair with the firm yet elastic step with which he mount the flight of the store if jack remain where he be they would meet what purpose in question now the answer to all might be as false as to one he be no more in a mood to trust himself with a word to he father than he have be to trust himself with a word to john prather he drop back into the darkness of the dining-room and sink into a chair when a bedroom door upstairs have close softly he be sequester in silence with he thought he own father have lie to he lie blandly lie with eye limpid with appeal and the supreme commandment on which he mother have ever insist be truth the least infraction of it she would not forgive it be the only thing for which she have ever punish he he recall the one occasion when she have seem harsh and merciless as she say : a lie foul the mouth of the one who utter it jack a lie may torture and kill it may ruin a life it be the weapon of the coward -- and never be a coward jack never be afraid at the new england preparatory school which he have attend after he come home a lie be the abomination on which the discipline of student comradeship lay a scourge out on the desert where the trail run straight and the battle of life be wage straight against thirst and fatigue and distance man speak straight and nothing have be explain after all the phantom be back definite of form and smile in irony for it have a face now the face of john prather how be he connect with the story of the mother the father the doge then like a shaft of light across memory come the recollection of a thing that have be so negligible to jack at the time it be dr bennington 's first question in jack 's living-room a question so carelessly put and so dissociate from the object of he visit jack remember dr bennington 's curious glance through he eyebrow as he ask he if he have meet john prather and dr bennington have bring jack into the world he know the family history the jack that now rise from the chair be a jack of action drive by the scourge of john prather 's smile into obsession with the one idea which be cry : i will know i will know downstairs in the hall he learn over the telephone that dr bennington have just go out on a call it would be possible to see he yet to-night a hour later as the doctor enter he reception-room he be startle by a pacing figure in the throe of impatience who turn on he without formality in a outburst : dr bennington you ask I in little river if i have ever meet john prather i have meet he who be he what be he to I the doctor 's suavity be throw off its balance but he do not lose he presence of mind he be too old a hand at he profession too capable for that i refuse to answer he say quickly and decisively then you do know jack take a step toward the doctor he weight be on the ball of he foot he eye have the fire of a command that be not to be resist heaven how like the ancestor the doctor exclaim involuntarily then you do know who be he what be he to I it seem as if the ceiling be about to crack the doctor look away to avoid the bear of jack 's unrelenting scrutiny he take a turn up and down rapidly nervously he finger press in against the palm and the muscle of he forearm move in the way of one who be try to hold himself in control by a outward expression of force against inward rebellion i dine with you father to-night he exclaim i counsel he to tell you the truth i say that if he do not want to tell it for its own sake as policy it be the only thing to you i -- i -- he stop face jack with a sort of grisly defiance jack a doctor be a confessor of man he keep they secret good-night and he stride through the office door which he close behind he sharply in reminder that the interview be at a end as jack go down the step into the night the face of john prather with a satirical turn to the lip be precede he now he walk madly up and down and back and forth across town to the river front with panting energy of stride as he fasten the leash of will on quivering nerve when dawn come it be the dawn of the desert call to a brain that have fight its way to a lucid purpose it start he to the store in the fervor of a grateful mission while a familiar greet keep repeat itself in he ear on the way : you will not forget jack about give I a chance to come along if you ever go out west again will you the question be one in answer to a promise a reminder from certain employee into whom he have fuse he own spirit of enthusiasm about dry waste yield abundance but you must work very hard he have tell they not until you have callouse on you hand can you succeed or really know how to enjoy a desert sunrise or sunset after that you will be able to stand erect and look destiny in the face no February slush burleigh the fitter have say no depend on one man to hold you job you own boss you own some land and you just naturally get what you earn accord to joe mathewson and from what i can

desert rube jack yes jack tell he the process that make the earth fruitful be not less complicated than a motor simply because it be one of the earliest invention you mix in nature 's carbureter light and moisture with the chemical element of the soil i be on the chauffeur rejoin if a man work with a plow instead of a screwdriver it do not follow that he mind be as vacant as a cow that stand stockstill in the middle of the road to show you that you can not fool she into think that radiator be good to eat in explain the labor and pain of orange-growing which end only with the careful picking and packing jack would talk as earnestly as he father would about the tedious detail which go into the purchase and sale of the article in any department of the store he might not be able to choose the best expert for the ribbon counter but he have a certain confidence that he could tell the man or the woman who would make good in little river no manager be more thorough in he observation of clerk for promotion than jack in observe would-be rancher he have give he promise to one after another of a test list of disciple and at time he have be surprise to find how serious both he and the disciple be over a matter that exist entirely on the hypothesis that he be not go to stay permanently in new york this morning he be at the store for the last time arrive even before the delivery division to circulate the news that he be return to little river trouble be brew out there he explain but they could depend on he he would make a place for they and send word when he be ready and all whom he have mark as faithful be eager to go thus he have build unwittingly for another future of responsibility when he have pause in the midst of the store 's responsibility to tell story of how a desert ranch be run but one disciple do not even want to wait on the message it be peter mortimer whom jack catch on he way to the elevator at eight he usual hour to make sure of have the letter open and systematically arrange when he employer should appear so you be go jack and -- and jack you know ask peter significantly yes peter and i see that you know i do but my word be give not to tell

devoutly before the portrait whose i give i give he now understand in new depths he think : i know that you would not want to remain here another hour you would want to go with I and before the portrait on the other side of the mantel he think challengingly and affectionately : and you you be a old devil no doubt but you would not lie no you would not lie to the admiralty or to elizabeth even to save you head yes you would want to go with I too tenderly he assist the butler to pack the portrait which be put in a cab when jack depart in they company this note lay on the desk in the

because it be mine i be take the portrait of the ancestor because i can not help it any more than he could help take a spanish galleon that be all i ask or ever could accept in the way of a inheritance jack xxxiv john wingfield you -- john wingfield sr have often make the boast that he never worry that he never take he business to bed with he when he head touch the pillow there be oblivion until he awake refresh to greet the problem leave over from yesterday such a mind must be a reliably co-ordinate piece of machinery with a pendulum in place of a heart it be overawe to average mortal who have not the temerity to say nonsense to great ego yet the best adjust clock may have a lapse in a powerful magnetic storm and in a earthquake they might even be tip off the shelf with they metal part render quite as helpless by the fall as those of a human organism subject to the constitutional weakness of the flesh it be also john wingfield sr 's boast to himself that he have never be beat which average mortal with the temerity to say nonsense -- that most equilibratory of word -- might have diagnose as a bad case of self-esteem find a way to forget the resent incidental reverse of success yet even average mortal note when john wingfield sr arrive late at the store the morning after jack 's departure for the west that he have not sleep well he haggardness suggest that for once the pushbutton to the switch of oblivion have fail he the smile of satisfied power be lack in the word of the elevator boy impersonal observer and swinger of door i never see the old man like that before but the upward flight through the street of he city if it do not bring back the smile bring back the old pride of ownership and domination he still have a kingdom he be still king resentment rise against the cause of the miserable twelve hour which have throw the machinery of he be out of order he pass the word to himself that he should sleep to-night and that from this moment henceforth thing would be the same as they have be before jack come home yes there be just one reality for he it be enthrone in he office this morning be to be like any other business morning like thousand of morning to come in the many year of activity that stretch ahead of he a little late he say explain he tardiness to he secretary a superfluity of word in which he would not ordinarily have indulge i have some thing to attend to on the outside with customary quiet attentiveness mortimer go through the mail with he employer who be frequently reassuring himself that he mind be as clear he answer as sure and he interest as concentrated as usual this task finish mortimer with he bundle of letter and note in hand instead of go out of the room when he have pass around the desk turn and face the man whom he have serve for thirty year mr wingfield -- well peter john wingfield sr look up sharply strike by mortimer 's tone which seem to come from another man in mortimer 's eye be a placid confident light and he stoop be less marked mr wingfield i be get on in year now he say and i have conclude to retire as soon as you have someone for my place the sooner sir the more agreeable to I what what put this idea into you head john wingfield sr snap often of late he have think that it be time he get a younger man in peter 's place but he do not like the initiative to come from peter not on this particular morning why just the notion that i should like to rest yes rest and play a little and grow rose and salad say the old secretary respectfully rose and salad what in -- where be you go to grow they there be something so serene about peter that he highly imperious poise employer find it impertinent not to say maddening peter have a look of the freedom of desert distance in he eye already a lieutenant be actually radiate happiness in that neutral-toned sanctum of power particularly this morning i be go out to little river or to some place that jack find for I where i be to have a garden and work -- or maybe i better call it potter around -- out of door in January and February just like it be June peter speak very genially as if he be try to win a disciple on he own account with jack oh gasp john wingfield sr he strike he closed fist into the palm of he hand in he favorite gesture of anger the antithesis of the crisp rubbing of the palm which he so rarely use of late year rage be contrary to the rule of longevity exciting the heart and exert pressure on the artery wall yes sir answer peter pleasantly well -- yes -- well jack have decide to go back then there rise strongly in john wingfield sr 's mind a suspicion that have be faintly signal to he keen observation of everything that go on in the store be any other employee go he demand yes sir i think there be not immediately but as soon as he find a place for they how many i do not think it be any secret about fifty sir name some of they joe mathewson that big fellow who drive a warehouse truck and burleigh and peter go on with those of the test proof list whom he know every one of they have high standing every one represent a value while at first john wingfield sr have decide savagely that mortimer should remain at he pleasure now he sense of outraged egoism take a opposite turn he could get on without mortimer he could get on if every employee in the store walk out there be more where they come from in a city of five million population and no one in the world know so well as he how to train they very good peter he say rigidly as if he be make a declaration of war fix up you papers and leave as soon as you please i will have one of the clerk take you place thank you that be very kind mr wingfield mortimer return so politely even exultantly that he aspect seem treasonable john wingfield sr try to concentrate he attention on some long and important letter that have be leave on he desk for further consideration but he mind refuse to stick to the line of typewrite this one be a little complicated he think i will lay it aside he try the second and the third letter with no better result a tan face and a pair of broad shoulder keep appear between he and the paper again he be think of jack as he have all night to the exclusion of everything else unquestionably this son have a lot of magnetic force in he he have command of man why he have win fifty of the best employee out of sheer sentiment to follow he out to the desert when they have no idea what they be in for he gaze fell and rest for some time on the bunch of rose on he desk every morning there have be a fresh bunch in keep with the custom that jack have establish the father have become so use to they presence that he be unconscious of it for all the pleasure he get out of they they might as well have be in the cornucopia vase in the limousine he hand go out spasmodically toward the rose as if he would crush they crush this symbol of the thing draw from the mother that have invade the calm autocracy of he existence the velvety richness of the petal lean toward he above the drooping grace of they stem make he pause in realization of the absurdity of he anger a feeling to which he have be a stranger sweep over he it be like a break instinct of dependableness and then he call up dr bennington well he have go he tell the doctor desperately you do not tell he the truth come the answer and he note that the doctor 's voice be without its usual suavity it be as matter-of-fact to the man of million as if it have be advise a operation in a dispensary case no not exactly john wingfield sr confess i tell you what he nature be how it have draw on the temperament of he mother i tell you that with candor with a decently human humility appeal to he affection everything be possible and remember he be strong stronger than you john wingfield there be a process of fate in he john wingfield you -- the sentence end abruptly as if the doctor have drop the receiver on the hook with a crash phantom be close in around john wingfield sr he memory range back over the day of ardent youth in the full tide of grow success when to want a thing human or material mean to have it and in he time he have tell a good many lie the right lie big and daring at the right moment have win more than one victory with john prather out of the way he have decide on a outright falsehood to he son why have he not compromise with dr bennington 's advice and try part falsehood and part contrition but no matter no matter he would go on he be make of steel again the tan face and broad shoulder stand between he and the page jack be strong yes strong and he be worth have all the old desire of possession reappear in company with he hatred of defeat he be think of the bare spot on the wall in the drawing-room in place of the velasquez there would be a end of he say : the boy be the spit of the ancestor and just as good a fighter too only he ability be turn into other channel more in keep with the spirit of the age a end of : fine son you have there from man at the club who have give he only a pass nod in the old day for he be not displeased that the boy be like where he himself be not the man whom he admire be those who have face he with no across the library desk who have get the better of he even if he do not admit it to himself and the strength of he son baffle to he cosmos have win he admiration no he would not lose jack 's strength without a effort he want it for he own perhaps something else too there in the loneliness of the office in the face of that bunch of rose be pull he : the thrill that he have feel when he see the moisture in jack 's eye and feel the warmth of he grasp before jack leave the library and jack and john prather be speeding west to the same destination they would meet what then there be no use of try to work in a office on broadway when the force which he have bring into be over twenty year ago be in danger of be unloose out on the desert with jack ride free and the finger of the ancestor-devil on the rein john wingfield sr call in the general manager you be in charge until i return he say and a few hour later he be in a private car bind for little river part iii he find he place in life xxxv back to little river as with the gentle touch of a familiar hand the ozone of high altitude gradually and sweetly awaken jack the engine be puff on a upgrade the car creak and lean in take a curve raise the shade of he berth he look out on spectral range that seem march and tumble through dim distance with pillow double under he head he lay back fill sight and mind with the indistinctness and spacious mystery of the desert at night recall he thought with he last view of it over two month ago in the morning hour after leave el paso and see he future with it now where then he have see he future with the store think of old burleigh raise orange i be sure that the tree will be well trim he whisper think of mamie devore in the thick of the great jelly competition while the weight of joe mathewson 's shoulder start a spade into the soil as if it be go right to the center of the earth why joe be likely to get we into international difficulty by poke the rib of a chinese ancestor yes -- if we do not lose we little river and we must not lose it the silvery face of the moon grow fainter with the come of a ruddier

of vision when joe see that he will feel so strong he will want to get out and carry the pullman jack thought but mamie will not let he for fear that he will overdo how slow the train seem to travel it be a snail compare to jack 's eagerness to arrive he be incline to think that pd wrath of god and jag ear be faster than through express he keep inquire of the conductor if they be on time and the conductor keep repeat that they be how near that flash of steel at a bend around a tongue of chaotic rock stretch out into the desert sea with its command to man to tunnel or accept a wind path for he iron horse how long in come to it in that rare air with its deceit of distance landmark after landmark of peak or bold ridge take the angle of some recollect view of he five year ' wanderings it be already noon when he see galerium from the far end of the long basin that he have cross with the v as the compass of he bearing on the ride that bring he to the top to meet mary and pete leddy then

could identify the doge 's and other bungalow he be on the platform of the car before the brake ground on the wheel lean out to see a crowd at the station which a minute later become a prospect of

the rain in a humid locality you see jim continue old man leffert ' partner have really never sell out to he so he transfer to the doge be not legal he turn he papers over to prather give prather full power to act for he in secure the partner ' surrender of they claim and straighten out everything with the territory and get a bonafide concession that be as i understand it for the whole business have be do in a underhand way prather represent to the doge that he be act entirely in the interest of the community and he only charge would be the cost the doge quite believe in prather 's single-mindedness and public spirit well with the use of money and all the influence he could command include the kind that pete leddy exercise he get the concession and in he name it be very smart work i suppose it be due to the crafty way he could direct the doge to do he wish that the doge happen to be off the scene at the critical stage of the negotiation when he go to new york all that remain be for he to obtain the capital for he scheme leffert and he partner have the underlie rights and the doge the later rights thanks to he improvement and prather have they both well leddy and he crowd have be take up plot right and leave that be they share in the exploitation they be here wait for the announcement to be make and -- well the water user ' association be still in charge but it will not be when prather say the word and you have no plan jack ask none and the doge none what can the old man do though nobody exactly blame he a good many be not of a mind to consult he at all the crisis have pass beyond he three or four man good man too be incline to have it out with john prather but that would have precipitate a general fight with leddy 's gang the conservative get the hot-head to wait till you come you see the trouble with every suggestion be that pretty much everybody be against it except the fellow who make it the more we have talk the more we have drift back to you it be a case of all we have get in the world and standing together and we be ready to get behind you and take order jack yes ready to fight at the drop of the hat seh or to sit still on we doorstep with we tongue in we cheek and do the wife ' mending as you say declare bob worther it be right up to you you be all of the same opinion ask jack they be with one voice which be not vociferous for theirs be that significantly quiet mood of a american crowd when easy-going good nature turn to steel they partisanship in pioneerdom have not be with six-shooter but with the ethic of the doge and such man when arouse do not precede action with threat all right say jack there be a rustle and a exchange of satisfied glance and a chorus of approval like a indrawing of breath first i will see the doge jack add and then i shall go to the house galway dr patterson worther and three or four other go on with he toward the ewold bungalow they be halt on the way by pete leddy ropey smith and a dozen follower who appear from a side street and stop across jack 's path every one of they with a certain slouching aggressiveness and stare hard at he pete and ropey still keep faith with they pledge to jack in the _ arroyo _ they be without gun but they companion be arm in defiance of the local ordinance which have be establish for jack 's protection howdy do leddy say jack as amiably as if there have never be anything but the pleasantest of relation between they get polite eh where 's you pretty whistle leddy answer i put it in storage in new york jack say laughing then with a sudden change to seriousness : leddy be it true that you and john prather have get the water rights to this town none of you d -- d business leddy rap out the only business i have get with you have be wait for some time and you can have it you way out in the _ arroyo _ where we have it before right now as i say pete i put the whistle in storage and i have already apologize for the way i use

i hope not pete naturally you hope so for you know i will get you you -- careful jack interrupted you would better leave that out until we be both armed or if you will not why we both have weapon that nature give we do you prefer that way and jack 's weight have shift to the ball of he foot plainly this be not to pete 's taste i do not want to bruise you i mean to make a clean hole through you he answer that be both courteous and merciful and you be very insistent leddy jack return and walk on just as sweet as honey just as cool as ice and just as sunny as June whisper bob worther to the man next he again jack be before the opening in the ewold hedge with its glimpse of the spacious living-room the big ivory paper-cutter lay in its accustomed place on the broad top of the florentine table in line with it on the wall be a photograph of abbey 's mural in the pennsylvanium capitol and through the open window a photograph of a puvis de chavanne be visible evidently the doge have already hang some of the reproduction of masterpiece which he have bring from new york but no one be on the porch or in the living-room the house be silent as jack start across the cement bridge he be halt by a laugh from he companion he find that pd be take no risk of lose he master again he be go right on into the doge 's too jim take charge of he receive in return a glance from the pony that positively reek of malice again jack be on he way around the doge 's bungalow on the journey he have make so many time in the grow ardor of the love that have master he sens the quiet of the garden seem a part of the pervasive stillness that stretch away to the pass from the broad path of the palm under the blazonry of the sun as he proceed he hear the crunching of gravel under a heavy tread the doge be pacing back and forth in the cross path fight despair with the force vigor of he step while mary be seat watch he as the doge wheel to face jack at the sound of he approach it be not in surprise but rather in preparedness for the expect appearance of another character in a drama this be also mary 's attitude they have hear of he come and they receive he call with a trace of fatalistic curiosity the doge suddenly drop on a bench as if overcome by the weariness and depression of spirit that he have be defy but there be something unyielding and indomitable in mary 's aspect well sir chap welcome say the doge we still have a seat in the shade for you will you sit down but jack remain standing as if what he have to say would be soon say i have come back and come for good he begin yes i have come back to take all the blue ribbon at ranch he add with a touch of garden nonsense that come like a second thought to soften the abruptness of he announcement for good for good you the doge stare at jack in incomprehension yes my future be out here now you give up the store -- the million -- you inheritance cry the doge still amaze and sceptical as he sound the preposterousness of this idea to worldly credulity quite there be no mistake the firmness of the word to make you fortune you life out here the doge 's voice be throb with the wonder of the thing yes why why i feel that i have a right to ask why demand the doge in all the majesty of the moment when he face john wingfield sr in the drawing-room because of a lie and what it conceal because of reason that may not be so vague to you as they be to I a lie yes a lie that come home the doge repeat while he pass he hand back and forth over he eye the hand be tremble indeed he whole body be tremble while he seek for self-control and to collect he thought for what he have to say to that still figure await he word when he look up it be with a expression wholly new to jack its candor be not that of transparent mental process in serene philosophy or forensic display but that of a man who be about to lay bare thing of the past which he have keep secret sir chap i be go to give you my story however weak and blameworthy it make I appear he say sir chap you see I in anger in the wingfield drawing-room further baffle you with a mystery which must have begin for you the night that you come to little river when we exchange a look in which i see that you know that i recognize you i try to talk as if you be a welcome stranger when i be hold in my rancor there be no other face in the world that i would not rather have see in this community than yours how glad i be to hear that you be leave by the morning train how i count the day of you convalescence after you be wound how glad i be at the news that you be to go as soon as you be well with what a revelry of suggestion i plan to speed you parting how demoralize i be when you announce that you be go to stay how amaze at you seriousness about ranching -- but how distrustful yet what joy in you companionship at time i want to get my arm around you and hug you as a scar old grizzly bear would hug a cub and first and last you success with everybody here you cool hand in the duel that iron in you will which would triumph at any cost when you break nogale 's arm for some reason you have choose to stop in the play period of youth on the way to the inheritance to overcome some obstacle that it pleased you to overcome and to amuse yourself a while in little river -- you with you steadiness in a fight and you airy smile confidence in yourself i -- i do not know that i be like that say jack in hurt grope surprise be i truly the doge nod as i see you he say jack look at mary frankly and calmly be i truly he ask she as i see you she repeat as a impersonal honest witness then i must have be he say with conviction but i hope that i shall not be in the future and he smile at mary wistfully but she gaze be bent on the ground and you want it all -- all the story from I the doge ask hesitate all jack answer it strike hard at you father the truth must strike where it will now then you face so like you father 's stand for the wreck of two life to I and for recollection in my own career that tinge my view of you jack you be one newcomer to little river to whom i could not wholly apply the desert rule of oblivion to the past and judgment of every man solely by he conduct in this community no it be out of the question that i could ever look at you without think who you be you know of course that you father and i spend we boyhood in burbridge once i find that he have tell I a untruth and we have we difference out as boy will and as i be in the right he confess the lie before i let he up that defeat be a hurt to he egoism that he could not forget he be that way john wingfield in he egoism it be like flint and he ambition and energy be without bound i remember he would say when tease that some day he should have more money than all the town together and when he have money no one would dare to tease he he have a remarkable gift of ingratiation with anyone who could be of service to he my uncle who be the head of the family be fond of he he see the possibility of success in this smart youngster in a new england village it be the ewold money that give john wingfield he start with it he buy the store in which he begin as a clerk he lose a good part of the ewold fortune later in one of he enterprise that do not turn out well but all this be trifling beside what be to come he go on to he great commercial career i poor fool be a egoist too i try to paint i have taste but no talent in outburst of despair my critical discrimination consign my own work to the rubbish heap i try to write book only to find that all i have be a head stuff with learn mixed with the philosophy that be death to the concentrated application that mean positive accomplishment but i could not create i be by nature only a drinker at the fountain only a student the pitiful student who could read he caesar at eight learn a language without half try but with no ability to make my knowledge of service with no masterful purpose of my own -- a failure no one be a failure who spread kindliness and culture as he go through life jack interrupted earnestly who give of himself unstintedly as you have who teach people to bring a tribute of flower to a convalescent why to find a town and make the desert bloom -- that be better than to add another book to the weight of library shelf or to get a picture on the line thank you jack say the doge with a flash of he happy manner of old while there be the play of fleeting sunshine over the hill and valley of he feature i will not call it persiflage i be too selfish too greedy of a little cheer to call it persiflage i like the illusion you suggest he be silent for a while and when he speak again it be with the tragic simplicity of one near he climax you father and i love the same girl -- you mother it seem that in every sympathy of mind and heart she and i be mean to travel the long highway together but you father win she with he gift for ingratiation with the object of he desire which amount to a kind of genius he win she with a lie and put I in a position that seem to prove that the lie be truth she accept he in reaction in a impulse of heart-break that follow what she believe to be a revelation of my true character as something far worse than that of idler i marry the woman whom he have make the object of he well-managed calumny my wife know where my heart be and why i have marry she it be from she that mary get she dark hair and the brown of she cheek which make she appear so at home on the desert soon after mary 's birth she choose to live apart from I -- but i will not speak further of she she be long ago dead i know that you mother have leave you father i see she a few time in europe but she never give the reason for the separation she would talk nothing of the past and with the year heavy on we shoulder and the memory of what we have be to each other hover close word come with difficulty and every one be painful she whole life be bind up in you as mine be in mary it be you that keep she from be a bitter cynic you that keep she alive some of the ewold money that john wingfield lose be mine you see how he keep on win how all the thread of he weave close in around I i come to the desert to give mary life with the fragment of my fortune and here i hope that as you say i have do something worthier than live the life of a wander leisurely student who have lapse into the observer for want of the capacity by nature or training to do anything else but sometimes i do long for the centre of civilization to touch elbow with they activity to feel the flow of the current of humanity in great street not that i want to give up little river but i want to go forth to fill the mind with argosy which i could enjoy here at my leisure and mary be young the longing that she conceal must be far more powerful than mine i see the supreme selfishness of shut she up on the desert without any glimpse of the outer world i sense the call that send she on she lonely ride to the pass i fear that you come have increase she restlessness but i wander that be my fault as you know sir chap well we come to the end of the weave to the finality of john wingfield 's victory little river be get out of hand i could plan a ranch but i have not a business head i have neither the gift nor the experience to deal with lawyer and land-grabber i know that with the increase of population and development we position be exciting the cupidity of those who find quicker profit in annex what other have build than in building on they own account i know that we ought to have a great dam that there be water to irrigate ten time the present irrigated area then come john prather i saw in he the judgment energy and ability for organization of a real man of affair he be young self-made engaging and convincing of manner he like we life and ideal in little river he want to share we future in he resemblance to you i see nothing but a coincidence that i pass over lightly he know how to handle the difficult situation that arise with the reappearance of old man leffert ' partner he would get the water rights legalize beyond dispute and turn they over to the water user ' association he would bring in capital for the dam the value of we property would be enhance little river would become a city in she own right while i be grow old delectably in the pride of founder so he picture it and so i dream i be so sure of the future that i dare the expense of a trip to new york and always to I when i look at you and when i thought of you you be the son of john wingfield you incarnate the inheritance of he strength but when from the drawing-room i see you father whom i have not see for fifteen year then -- well the thing come to I in a burning second the while i glimpse he face before he see mine he be smile as if please with himself and he power he be rub the palm of he hand together and i see that it be john prather who be like john wingfield in manner pose and feature you be like the fight man you ancestor and you airy confidence be he and i witless and unperceiving have be win by the same method of ingratiation with which john wingfield have win the assistance of the ewold fortune for the first step of he career with which he have win alice jamison and keep I unaware of he plan while he be lie to she finally let we say in all charity that you father be what he be because of what be bear in he and for the same reason that the snowball gather size as it roll and i be what i be for the same reason that the wind scatter the sand of the desert -- a man full of book and tangent inconsequence of idea without sense a simpleton who know a painting but do not know man a garrulous philosophizing blind old simpleton whose pompous incompetency have betray a trust through I man and woman come here to settle and make a home through I they lose -- to my shame the doge bury he face in he hand and draw a deep breath more pitiful than a sob which as it go free of the lung seem to leave a empty ruin of what have once be a splendid edifice he be in striking contrast to mary who throughout the story fondly regard he have remain as straight as a young pine now with she rigidity suddenly become so pliant that it be a fluid thing mixed of indignation fearlessness and compelling sympathy she spring to he side she know the touchstone to she father 's emotion he do not want he cheek pat in that moment of agony he want a stimulant some justification for live there be no shame in believe in those who speak fairly there be honor the honor of faith in mankind she cry penetratingly there be no shame in be the victim of lie no no shame the doge cry rise unsteadily to he foot under the whip and we be not afraid for the future she continue and the other man and woman in little river be not afraid for the future no not afraid under this sun in this air afraid a unconquerable flame have come into he eye in answer to that in mary 's the other have ask I to act for they and i think i may yet save we rights say jack will you also trust I will i trust you jack trust you who give up you inheritance exclaim the doge i would trust you on a mission to the star or to lead a regiment and the wish of the other be mine jack have turn to go but he look back at mary and you mary i have you good wish he could not resist that question and though it be clear that nothing could stay he -- as clear as it have be in the _ arroyo _ that he would keep he word and face leddy -- he be hang on she word and he be see she eye moist with a bright fire like that of sunshine on still water she be sway slightly as a young pine might in a wind she eye darken as with fear then she cheek go crimson with the stir of she blood and suddenly she eye be sparkling in they moisture like water when it ripple under sunshine yes jack she say quietly with the tense eagerness of a good cause that send a man away to the war that be everything he answer so it be everything that he could ask now with he story and hers so fresh in mind he start up the path but stop at the turn to look back and wave he hand to the two figure in a confident gesture luck with you sir chap call the doge with all the far-carrying force of he oldtime sonorousness luck luck mary call on she part and she voice have a flute note that seem to go singing on its own ether wave through the tender green foliage through all the garden of little river and even away to the pass mary mary he answer with a ring of cheeriness luck for I will always come at you command a moment later galway and the other see he smile with a hope that run as high as he purpose as he pass through the gateway of the hedge it will all be right he tell they with pd keep he muzzle close to the middle of jack 's back the party start toward he house which take they almost the length of the main street prather go by the range trail of course jack ask galway no straight out across the desert say galway straight out across the desert exclaim jack mystified for one have a choice of two route to agua fria which be well over the border in mexico not a drop of water be to be have on the way across the trackless plateau but halfway on the range trail be a camping-place las cascadas where a spring which spout in a tiny cascade welcome the traveller under irrigation most of the land for the whole stretch between the two town would be fertile there be say to be a big underground run at agua fria that could be pump at little expense all i can make out of prather 's take a straight line which really be slower as you know on account of the heavy sand in place be to look over the soil say galway he may be prepare to get a concession in mexico at the same time as on this side so as to secure control of the whole valley it mean railroad factory new town million -- but you and i have talk all this before in we dream who be with he jack ask pedro nogale he seem to have take quite a fancy to pedro and pedro be act as guide leddy recommend he i suppose no one else no good say jack as they turn into the side street where the front of jack 's bungalow be visible jim galway observe that they have see nothing of leddy or any of he follower maybe he be go to join prather say bob worther but jack pay no attention to the remark he be preoccupy with the first sight of he ranch in over two month it will be all right he call out to the crowd in he yard for the other who have meet he at the station be wait for he there bob those umbrella-tree could shade a thin short man now even if he do not hug the trunk firio have do well have not he he conclude after he have walk through the garden and survey the field and orchard in fond comparison as to progress the best i ever know a indian to do say jim galway and everything keep right on grow while i be away that be the joy of plant thing they be grow for somebody if not for you inside the house he find firio with the help of some of the rancher take the picture out of they case firio survey the buccaneer for some time squint he eye and finally open they saucer-wide in approval you he say to jack and of the sargent after equally deliberate observation he say : a lady that seem about all there be to say and express the thought of the onlooker and firio now it be the trail say jack _ sí sí _ say firio ever so softly we take rifle yes food for a week and two-day ' water it please jack to hang the portrait while firio be put on jag ear 's pack and he make it a ceremony in which he silence be uninterrupted by the comment of the rancher they stand in wonder awe before john wingfield knight hang where he could watch the eternal painter at he sunset display and look at the portrait of a lady across the breadth of the living-room whose neutral tone make a perfect setting for they dominant genius i believe they be at home say jack with a fond look from one to the other when firio come to say that everything be ready señor jack whisper firio insinuatingly for the trail you wear the grand glad trail clothes and the big spur i keep they shiny -- the big spur he be speak with the authority of a expert in trail fashion who would consider jack in very bad form if he refuse why yes firio yes it be so long since we have be on the trail and he go into the bedroom to make the change i have never see he quite so dumb quiet say worther jack certainly have be quiet ominously quiet and self-contained when he come out of the bedroom he be without the jaunty freedom of manner that little river always associate with he full regalia in place of the dreamy distance in he eye on such occasion be a sad preoccupation and determination when they go outside to firio and the wait pony the eternal painter be in he evening orgy of splendor but even jack do not look up at the sky this time as he walk along in silence with he fellow-citizen to the point where the farthest furrow of he ranch have be draw across the virgin desert he foot be already in the stirrup when jim galway speak the thought of all : jack there be only two of you and if it happen that you meet leddy -- it be prather that i want to see jack answer but leddy 's whole gang we do not know what you plan be but if there be go to be a mix-up why we have get to be with you no say jack decidedly remember jim you be to trust I this be a mission that require only two it be between prather and I we be go to get acquaint for the first time already firio ride wrath of god have start and the bell of jag ear be jingle while the rifle they bore so clean from firio 's care dance with the gleam of sunset in they movement with the burro 's jogging trot jack spring into the saddle he face lighting as the foot come home in the stirrup it will be all right he call back pd in the freshness of he long holiday feel a familiar pressure of a leg hasten to overtake he companion and the group of little riversite watch a chubby horseman and a tall gaunt horseman bath in gold ride away on a hazy sea of gold with jag ear 's bell grow fainter and fainter until the move speck be lose in the darkness xxxvi around the water-hole easy traveller have turn speedy traveller on a schedule never have he and firio ridden so fast as in pursuit of john prather who have eight hour ' start of they on a two-day ' journey jag ear have to trot all the time to keep up ounce by ounce he be draw on he sink fund of fat in a constitutional crisis i keep he hoof good i keep he wind good all right say firio it be after midnight before the steady jingle of jag ear 's orchestra have any intermission a hour for food and rest and the little party be off again in the delicious cool of the night toward a curtain prick with star which seem to be draw down over the edge of the world what sort of horse have prather and nogale jack ask he must reach the water-hole as soon as prather for it be not unlikely that prather might have fresh mount wait there to take he on to the nearest railroad station in mexico look good but bad nogale no know horse firio answer and they ride in the heat of the day say jack confidently _ sí _ and we ride pd and wrath of god there be no sign-post on this highway of desert space except the many-armed giant cactus in they furrowed armor set with cluster of needle like tawny aurora gleam faintly no trail on the hard earth under foot mottle with bunch of sagebrush and spray of low-lying cactus all as still as the figure of a inlaid flooring in the violet sheen with a occasional quick irregular shadowy movement when a frightened lizard or a gopher beat a precipitate retreat from the invade thud of hoof in this sanctuary of dust-dry life and the course of the hoof be set midway between the loom mass of the mountain wall of the valley firio listen for song from señor jack he wait for story from señor jack but none come he the untalkative one of the pair the living embodiment of a silent and happy companionship back and forth from colorado to chihuahua like to hear talk without it he be lonesome if by the criterion of a school examination he never understand more than half of what jack say yet in the measure of spirit he understand everything now jack be go mile after mile with nothing except occasional urge word to pd he close-cut hair well brush back from he forehead reveal the sweep of he brow lengthen he profile and add to the effect of he leanness the moonlight on he face which have lose its tan give he a aspect of subdue and patient serenity in keep with the surroundings you would have say that he could ride on forever without tire and that he could go over a precipice now without even see any danger sign he have never be like this in all firio 's memory the silence become unsupportable for once to indian taciturnity if jack would not talk firio would yes he would ask a question just to hear the sound of a voice we go to fight no firio not to fight prather no to fight leddy i hope not why we go why so -- why so -- he have not the language to express the strange brooding inquiry of he mind i go to save little river _ sí _ say firio but as if this do not answer he question i go to get the end of a story firio -- my story continue jack i have travel long for the story and now i shall have it all from john prather _ sí sí _ say firio as if all the knowledge in the world have flash into he head quicker than the hand of legerdemain could run the leaf of a pack of card through its finger and then at last firio have win a smile from the untanned face which could not be the same to he until it be tan then i shall plant seed and keep the ground around they soft and the weed out of it and i shall wear my heart on my sleeve and lay a siege -- a siege in the open without parallel or mine a siege in the open firio do not understand much about parallel or mine or for that matter about siege but he could see the smile fading from jack 's lip and could comprehend that the future of which jack be speak be very far from another prospect which be immediate and vivid in he mind but you must fight leddy _ sí sí _ you must fight leddy first then i must i suppose say jack absently all thing in they turn and time _ sí _ answer firio all thing in they turn and time this desert truth be breed in he through he ancestry no less than in the eternal painter himself again the silence of the morning darkness with all the star twinkle more faintly and some slip from they place in the curtain into the deeper recess of the broad band of night on the surface of the rolling ball the plod hoof keep up they regular beat of the march of they little world of action in the presence of the infinite plodding plod on into the dawn which send the last of the star in flight while the curtain melt away before blue distance swim with light still bareheaded jack look into the face of the sun which heave above a irregular roof of rock it blaze into the range on the other side of the valley it slake its thirst with the slight fall of dew as a great red tongue would lick up crumb sun and sky cactus and sagebrush rock and dry earth and sand that be all nowhere in that stretch of basin that seem without end be there a sign of any other horseman or of human life but at length as they ride they eye see what only eye use to desert reach could see that the speck in the distance be not a cactus or even two or three cactus in line but something alive and move perceptibly they be gain on it while it develop into two rider and a pack animal in single file now jack and firio be come into a region of more stunt vegetation and soon the two figure emerge into a stretch of gray carpet on which they be as clearly silhouette as a white sail on a green sea very thick sand there -- five or six mile of it it make this the long way say firio they call it the apron of hell to fool who ride at noon and beyond that how many mile to the water-hole five or six but firio know a way around where the go be good it make a difference of two or three mile in distance against they but two or three time that in they favor in time and the strength take out of they pony how long will prather be in get through the sand jack ask firio squint at the object of they pursuit for a while as if he want to be exact almost as many hour as mile he say near the zenith now the sun be a bulge furnace eye pierce through shirt into the flesh and suck the very moisture of the vein a single catspaw be all that the eternal painter have to offer over that basin shut in between the long jagged tooth of the range bite into the steel-blue of the sky the savage merciless hour of the desert day approach the hour of reckon for unknowing and unprepared traveller jag ear 's bell have a faint plaintiveness at interval and again they jingle be rapid and hysterical as he try to make up the distance lose through a lapse in effort he have cease altogether to wiggle the sliver of ear -- the baton with which he conduct he orchestra -- because this be clearly a waste of energy pd 's step still retain they dogged persistence but they regular beat be slower like that of a clock that need wind he head hang low wrath of god be no more and no less melancholy than when he be rusticate in jack 's yard it seem as if he sad visage so reliably and grandly sad might still be march on toward the indeterminate line of the horizon when he leg be wear off he body firio you brown son of the sun say jack with a sudden display of he old-time trail imagery you prolix garrulous firio you know you have the great equine trio ready and look at the mile they have do since sunset to prove it you pd favorite trooper of we household cavalry you wrath of god do not be afraid to make a inward smile for you face will never tell on you you jag ear beat a tattoo with the fragment of the gothic glory of burrohood for we rest to go on all the faster when the heat of the day be past while prather and nogale be ride over hell 's apron they pursuer have saddle off hot moist back over which know hand be run to find no sore after they have eat pd and wrath of god and jag ear stand in droop relaxation which would make the most of every moment of respite jack and firio with a blanket fasten to the rifle as standard make a patch of shade in which they lay down have a nap firio say jack i will wake you when it be time to start and you -- you no sleep ask firio i could not sleep to-day jack answer i do not feel as if i could sleep until i have see prather and hear he story -- my story -- firio and he lay with eye half close stare at the steel blue overhead it be well after midday when they mount for the remainder of the journey the eternal painter be shake out the silvery cloud-mist of he beard across a background that have a softer kindlier deeper blue the shadow of the pony and they rider and jag ear and he pack no longer lay under they belly heavily but be stretch out to one side by the angle of the sun in cheerful jogging fraternity prather and nogale have again become only a speck do you think that they be out of the sand ask jack very near firio answer they pony have a whole night 's rest -- we must not forget that say jack and they must be in a hurry for certainly nogale have sense enough to rest over noon _ quien sabe _ answer firio but we catch they -- _ sí sí _ lead the way firio turn toward the eastern range until he come to a narrow tongue of shale almost as hard to the hoof as asphalt that run like a shoal across that sea of sand rest have give the great equine trio renew life pd reduce in rank to second place could not think of allow more than a foot between he muzzle and the tail of wrath of god who be bind to make up the time he have lose in pursuit of the horizon another hypothesis of jack 's as to the cause of wrath of god 's melancholy be that solemn covenanter 's inability to get any nearer to the edge of the earth once he could poke he nose through the blue curtain and see what be on the other side the satisfaction of he eternal curiosity might have make he a rollick comedian as for jag ear he baton be once more conduct he orchestra in spirited tempo he who be nearest of all three in heart to firio might well have be say to himself : i know i know we be not go through the sand firio and i know so rapidly be they gain that when past the sand and they turn back westward it be only a question of half a hour or so to come up with prather and nogale nogale have be ride ahead but now prather after gaze over he shoulder for some time at he pursuer take the lead he be urge he horse as if he would avoid be overtaken evidently nogale do not share that desire for he let prather go on alone but prather 's horse be too tire after its effort in the sand and he halt and wait until nogale at a slow walk close up the gap between they when they proceed at they old weary gait as jack and firio come within hail distance both prather and nogale glance at they sharply but no word be speak on either side the absence of any call between these isolate voyager of the desert sea be strangely unlike the average desert meeting prather and nogale do not look back again not even when jack and firio be very near a neigh by pd a break into a trot by he and wrath of god and firio be say to nogale : you go right through the sand _ sí _ answer pedro with a grin still prather do not so much as turn he head to get a glimpse of jack nor do he offer any sign of knowledge of jack 's presence when jack rein alongside he so close that they stirrup leather be brushing prather be gaze at the desert exactly in front of he the rein hang loose almost out of hand he horse be about spend if not on the point of founder jack be so near the mole on the cheek of the peculiar paleness that never tan that by half extend he arm he might have touch it after all it be only a raise patch of blue a blemish removable by the slightest surgical operation which its owner must have prefer to retain firio and nogale also ride side by side be also silent there be no sound except jag ear 's bell now sink to a faint tinkle in keep with the slow progress of prather 's beaten horse look at prather 's hand jack be think of another pair of hand amazingly like they in the uncanniness of its proximity he be imagine how the profile would look without the birthmark and he find himself grateful for the silence which speak so powerfully to he in the time that it provide for bring he faculty under control how do you do he say at last pleasantly probably the silence have be equally welcome to prather in chart he own course in the now unavoidable interview he look around slowly and he be smile with a trace of the satire that jack have see in the elevator but smile watchfully in a way that cover the apprehension of a keen glance and he see feature that be calm and eye that be still as the sky how do you do he answer and pause as one who be about to slip a point of steel home into a scabbard how do you do brother he add as if utter a shibboleth that could protect he from any physical violence brother brother yes repeat jack with dry lip this shaping of conviction into fact so nakedly so coolly make all the desert and the sky swim before he in kaleidoscopic patch of blue and gray shot with zigzag flash he half reel in the saddle he hand grip the pommel to hold himself in place it be as if a long strain of nervous tension have come to a end with a crack prather 's smile take a turn of deeper satisfaction it be like john wingfield sr 's after jack have leave the library this be the first time we have ever meet to speak say prather easily yes assent jack the gray settle back into desert and the blue into sky and the zigzag flash become only the brilliance of late afternoon sunshine certainly it be time that we get acquaint brother say prather it be agree jack it be time that i know you story which you have hardly hear from you -- i mean we father the pause between the you and the we be make with a appreciative significance well you see i be the brother who have the mole on he cheek yes -- pitifully yes say jack with a kind of horror at the expression of this face in he father 's likeness no less than at the word why no i have often think of _ you _ rather pitifully say prather you well might jack answer feelingly we may well share a common pity for each other there be no sign that john prather subscribe to the sentiment except in a certain quizzical turn of he lip as he look away yes the story have be keep from I i have come for it say jack that be rake out the skeleton but why not rake out we skeleton together you and i say prather it be clear that he enjoy the prospect as a opportunity for retributive enlightenment to begin with i have the rights of primogeniture in my favor he say i be bear a day before you be in the same city of new york my mother 's name be not down in the telephone list as mr wingfield however -- i look at it all philosophically you understand -- and it be just that which make the difference between you and I outside of the difference of we nature but i be proud of my birth on both side in my own way my mother be win without marriage and she be true to father a woman of real ability my mother she be well suit to be john wingfield 's wife better i think in the practical world of materialism than you mother by a peculiar coincidence unknown to father my mother call in dr bennington so you and i have a further bond in that the same doctor bring we into the world and my mother must have know this jack exclaim in rack horror at last the cause of she exile be clear in all its grisly monstrousness the source of the pain in she eye in the portrait have be trace home again he see she white and tremble when she return to the house in versaille to find a visitor there and now he realize the fulness of she relief when the frail boy say that he do not like he father she travels have speak the restlessness of flight in search of oblivion to the very fact of he paternity the i give i give of the portrait be the give of the infinity of she fine sensitive be to he to make he all hers he feeling which have hold he on the desert when he should have go home that feeling of literal revulsion toward he inheritance be a thing bear in he which have grow under she caress and she training she have be live solely for he to that last moment when the book drop out of she hand and the incarnation of that which have kill she be ride beside he now in the flesh he feel a weave of he muscle a tightening of he nerve as if wait on the spark of will and all the strength that he have build in the name of the store be madly tempt but no john prather be not to blame any more than himself he would listen to john prather as justice listen to evidence and endure he stare to the end yes you mother know continued prather my mother make a point of have she know that be part of my mother 's own bitterness that be she teaching to I from the first she have no illusion she know the advantage and the disadvantage of she position she be and be one of the few person in the world of whom my father be a little afraid then she still live asked jack sharply yes she be in californium prather return she often refer to the mole on my cheek as the symbol of my handicap in the world of convention ` but for the mole jack you would have the store ' she often say it delight she that i have my father 's face as i grow older the resemblance become more marked i could see that i pleased my father with my practical idea of life which i develop when quite young he see to it that my mother and i live well and that i go to a good school from my book i draw the same lesson as from my peculiar inheritance the lesson that my mother be always inculcate ' a bank account ' she would repeat ` will erase even a mole patch on the cheek it be the supreme power that will carry you anywhere jack you must make money ' when father come to see she he would talk with a candor with which i be sure he never talk to you mother he would tell of he success reveal the strategy and system by which they be win find she both understanding and sympathetic i become a little blade that delight to get sharp against he big blade by ask he question he do not want I about the store and this be one of the thing in which my mother humor he she know just when to humor and just when to threaten the play of the strong card which she always hold all the while she ambition be lay its plan it be that i should have the wingfield store one day myself out of school hour i would range the other department store you see i have not only inherit my father 's face more strikingly than you have but also he talent i spend the summer vacation of my fourteenth and fifteenth year in a store i win the attention of my superior and promise of promotion i foresee the day when i should so prove my ability that father would take I into he own store and then gradually i would make my place secure while you be idle about europe and in those day you be frail and i be vigorous there be no mistaking that father 's sense of convention be the one thing that stand between he and my desire he fear the world 's opinion if the truth become known and deep down in heart he could never get over the pride of have marry into you mother 's family you have very good blood on the maternal side as they say while my mother have begin in the cloak department and be self-made like father again i be so truly he son in every instinct that he may have be a little jealous of I father do not like to think that any other man be ever quite as great as he be i confess that be the way i feel too that be what life be after all -- it be yourself yes i see the store as mine -- surely mine with time prather 's rein lay across the pommel of the saddle draw taut by the drooping head of he horse which be barely drag one foot after another he give jack a glance of flash resentment and then in he first impulse of real emotion make a fist of one hand and drive it angrily into the palm of the other before continue then father go to europe to bring you home he have decide for the son of convention the son of blood though self-made he be for family as against talent besides it be a victory for he at last you be he after you return there be a scene between mother and he a cool bitter argument he defy she to play she last card he say that you know the truth and that she could at best only make a row and he want we out of new york the place for I be a new country he would make we a handsome allowance so my mother agree to he term and we go to the pacific coast there i be to enter one of the college my mother want I to have a college education you see the last meeting between father and I be very interesting blade playing on blade he really hate to let I go for by this time he know how hopeless you be he embrace I and say that i would get on anyway i tell he that the only trouble be that while i be the real son i have a mole on my cheek the west be best there we could claim the favor of convention mr prather and she son i matriculated at stanford but i see nothing in it for I it be all dream stuff greek and latin do not help in build a fortune they handicap you with the loss of time it take to learn they at least and i mean to be worth a million before i be thirty now i know that i shall be worth two or three or four million at thirty if all go as i plan so i cut college and break for goldfield i run a store and be a secret partner in a saloon that pay better than the store i be in the game morning noon and night it beat march to class to recite horace and fiddle with the binomial theorem as it must for every man who count for something in the world throughout prather 's tone except for the one moment of anger have be that of a even recital of fact by one who do not allow himself to consider anything but fact in the judgment of he position at time he give jack covert glance out of the tail of he eye and see jack 's face white and draw and he head lower now prather become the victim -- so he would have put it no doubt -- of another outburst of feeling but it be not like have the store he say no my heart be in the store and that morning when you see I look down from the gallery i be permit myself to dream i be think of what have come to you the fairy prince of good fortune who have no talent for you inheritance and of what i might have do with it i be think how i could win man to work for I -- and there he be smile with the father 's charm -- and of the million to come if i could begin to build on the foundation that father have lay i see branch in chicago boston philadelphia -- a great chain of store all co-ordinate under my direct hand -- i the master he rub the palm of he hand together as he have over the scintillation of the jewelry counter though jack have not look around he ear recognize that crisp sound of exultant power yes jack murmur thoughtfully as if invite prather to go on with anything further he might have to say all mine -- mine prather conclude in a sort of hypnosis with he own picture jack still stare at the earth he profile limn in gold and the side of he face toward prather in shadow they be near the clump of cotton-wood around the water-hole at the base of a tongue of the range which run out into the desert and firio ride up to whisper in spanish : señor jack see there horseman jack raise he head with a return sense of he surroundings to see some mount man eight in all he count ride along the range trail a half mile nearer the water-hole than themselves they horse have the gait of exhaustion after a long hard ride you know who it be firio whisper yes jack answer they have the better trail and have outride we all right firio leddy -- pete leddy and some of he man exclaim prather shade he eye to watch the file of figure now pass under the cotton-wood it seem to relieve he i suppose he come on my account he add nod to nogale yes say nogale with a grin he always either grin or he face have a half savage impassiveness i wonder if leddy think i be in danger and prather give jack a know glance of satisfaction we shall all camp together he add smile jack do not answer for a moment he be intent on the cotton-wood leddy and he companion appear on the other side the figure of rider and horse bath in the sunset glow then they disappear as if the earth have swallow they up they be go on they be not go to stop say prather apprehensively there be a basin beyond the water-hole and the seepage make a little pasture jack explain you will see they back in a moment oh yes say prather with a thrill in he voice and again the palm of he hand be make that refrain of delight but i have tell my story he resume now may i ask you a question why have you come back jack look around frankly and dispassionately to save little river from you i understand that you have secure the water rights well then i have declare prather confidently and i mean to have the rights for the whole valley and he strike he fist into he palm you see he go on with another flash of satire it be not exactly fair that you should have the store and little river too i have hear of the possibility here from my friend leddy who be also at goldfield a useful man in he place he get he sixth notch there when i come and look around and see that here be the opportunity i want i wire father that in any fair division of territory everything west of the mississippus belong to I -- he be show some bravado in he sense of security now when he see that leddy and he man be return through the cotton-wood to the water-hole -- and i should like to have you out of my way i tell he you be the picture of health even if you do not have anything in you head and if you be ever go to learn the business it be time that you begin but father be always careful naturally he want to check off my report with another be for he do not want you back if you be ill so he send dr bennington out to get professional confirmation of my statement and you tell jasper ewold that you want the rights only to turn they over to the water user ' association and then bring in capital to build a dam with everybody sharing alike in the prosperity that be to come yes and jasper ewold be so simple well what i tell he be strategy -- strategy of which i think father would approve when you have a big object in view the end must justify the means look at the situation two hundred thousand acre of land wait on water to be the most fertile in the world why when i ride up the valley the first time and see what could be do i be amaze to think that such a opportunity should be lie around loose little river be so out of the way that other promoter have overlook it and everybody have sort of take it for grant that jasper ewold and he water user ' association really have legal possession it be my chance i think big that dam should be mine i have the money i have make in goldfield but it be not enough for my purpose where should i turn for outside capital that would not demand a majority interest in the project i conclude that it be time father do something for I in return for give up the store besides this call of justice i have another influence with he i be sure that when he tell my mother that you know the truth he be make a statement that suit he purpose i be sure that you know nothing of my story and that father do not want you to know it i be ready to tell if he do not meet my demand well you know how he can talk when he want to gain a point i fancy that i talk as well as father when i show he how that dam would pay for itself in five year in toll and twenty per cent on the capital after that when i show he how a population ten time that of he store would have to take they water from I when i show he all the side issue of profit from town site and the increase of value of the big holding which leddy 's man would take up for I you ought to have see he eye glow he could not withstand he pride in I ` you have the gift the one gift ' he say i tell he yes it be in the blood and i strike while the iron be hot i get a outright sum from he and he could not resist a chance to share all that profit when capital be to be have in new york for three or four per cent he go in as silent partner as i be in the saloon at goldfield as a partner with a minority interest john prather pause to laugh to himself over he victory while the movement of palm on palm be rapid and prolonged we arrangement amount to the commercial division of territory for the family which i have suggest he go on with appreciative irony you and he be to have the east side of the mississippus and i be to have the west and you be never to know my story publicly father and i be stranger and quit and we come to this agreement in the room of a down-town hotel the day before i start west i simply have to have a look through the store -- the store that i loved and that i have to lose yes the store be far more to my taste than this rough western life naturally as my existence be to be keep a secret from you when you follow I to the elevator and try to get acquaint i could not have it but as the elevator descend you point to the mole say jack do i i suppose that be a involuntary instinctive pleasantry the previous evening father and i have have a farewell visit together we go into the country the night after the scene in the drawing-room jack think i know that father be worry because he have to make a effort to show that he be not usually he can cover he worry perfectly he say that he might have a fight in order to keep you and that he very much want you to stay but he do not succeed conclude prather fist drive into palm you come on the express after I because fortunately you go to the house to have a look at the ancestor yes say prather but i do not see you however i see you from the landing and overhear what pass between you and father no matter cry prather harshly i be prepare for you he look toward the water-hole significantly and the concession be mine the dam will be mine the dam could be build and all the valley might bloom without so much power pass into the hand of one man say jack pd scent the pasturage and feel the pang of thirst be start forward at a smarter pace but jack hold he back to the snail 's crawl of prather 's pony who would do it jasper ewold jim galway prather demand what these man need be a leader they do not realize what i be do for they do they think i want to put in ten year out here for nothing for every dollar that they make for I they be go to make one for themselves that be the rule of prosperity i be not rob they i be take only my fair share in return for creative business genius the fellow in little river who sulk and do not get on will have only themselves to thank but they lose they independence jack be argue quietly as if he would thrash out the subject there be other thing than money in this world there be nothing much money will not do say prather it will not give one self-respect or courage or moral fiber it will not bring the gift of poetry music or painting or turn a lie into truth or bring back virtue to a woman who have be defile or make the courage to face death calmly it will do all i want prather answer father not have be true to he agreement by keep you in new york why should i keep he secret he break faith i break faith it seem to I as if there be no escape the penalty of my birth i no sooner arrive than i find the whole town know of you return and not only that but a wire come from father say that we have better not meet until he come until he come yes go on well as you say you be here to save little river and that mean a interview with I and -- well again the palm in they crisp movement before i start out i tell pete leddy that if you come after I i should look to he for protection and it seem he be on time yes say jack without look at prather all the while he have keep watch on the water-hole and he receive prather 's announcement stoically as a confirmation of he suspicion so if you will take my advice brother the best thing for you to do be to ride back before we reach the water-hole unless you prefer leddy 's company this time he will fight you in he way my horse be tired and there be neither water nor feed for he except there jack state this quietly and stubbornly as he nod toward the cotton-wood then he look around to prather suddenly prather find himself look at a face that seem to have only the form of that face by the side of which he have be ride it be as if another man have take jack 's place in the saddle the ancestor be rise in jack prather see a electric spark in jack 's eye the spark of the high voltage that make he muscle weave and a flutter come in he cheek no i be not go back until i have recover the rights that you have take from little river he say prather in sudden confusion realize that he have let he feeling go too soon they be not yet at the water-hole and he be within easy reach of that hand work on the rein in a way that promise a outburst you think of physical violence against I -- you own flesh and blood he say defensively he see jack shudder in reaction and know that he be safe for the moment when jack look away at the water-hole prather 's finger slip to he own six-shooter and rest there twitch nervously and in the rear firio be watch both he and nogale shrewdly from any outward sign now jack might have be start on another journey with quiet eagerness a journey that might end at a precipice a few yard ahead or at the other side of the world of this alone you could be sure from the resoluteness of he feature that he be go straight on while firio in the telepathy of desert companionship understand that he be miss no develop detail within the narrow range of vision in front of pd 's nose trust all to jack firio be on wire ready for a spring in any direction they be come to the edge of a depression of a old watercourse that wind around past the cotton-wood to the ridge itself and include the basin where leddy and he follower have tethered they horse but this part of it be dry sand the standing figure around the water-hole have sink down jack could see they as lump in a row a blade of flame from the setting sun fall on they reveal the glint of rifle barrel firio quick -- down pd down jack call dismount with a leap and as though in answer to he warning come the singing of bullet about they ear pd have be train to sink on all fours at a word and he and jack together drop into the cover of the _ arroyo _ below the desert line when he look around firio be at he side still hold the rein of wrath of god but wrath of god 's sturdy plod nature have little facility in learn trick a tiny stream of blood be flow down he forehead and he lay still at last all in loyal service he have reach the horizon he bony homely good old face seem singularly peaceful as if satisfy with the reward at he journey 's end jag ear be stand beside pd and prather 's burro next to he both unharmed nogale 's horse have also be kill but its rider be safe prather be crawl down the side of the _ arroyo _ on he belly digging he hand into the dirt he face white and contorted and he eye shift back and forth in ghastly incomprehension he horse follow he and sink down in final surrender to exhaustion by common impulse jack and firio seize the rifle from jag ear 's pack while nogale a spectator squat beside prather what -- what do it mean prather gasp spasmodically i -- i -- be it leddy that fire on we yes say jack over he shoulder as he and firio start up the bank of the _ arroyo _ face the water-hole no doubt of it it be you they want -- not I -- not I i -- i -- i do not know at all event i do not mean they shall rush we jack answer as he and firio hug the slope with they rifle rest on top and only they head show above it no it could not be that they recognize I they will let I by they expect I yes you belong on they side jack call back i will send out a flag of truce say prather brighten with the think you nogale take my handkerchief and go and explain to leddy nogale seem agreeable to the suggestion indeed he be very expeditious in start while jack never take he eye off the sight of he barrel nogale walk across the gleaming interval between the two party wave prather 's handkerchief leddy rise on he knee watchfully rifle in hand while he speak with nogale then nogale start back with he head throw up jubilantly but stop when he be within call distance and sing out truculently : leddy get you both he get everything he turn on he heel and soon be another lump around the water-hole that make nine firio say jack he smile in relief to be rid of nogale smile in happy confidence as if he be truly the ancestor 's child _ sí _ answer firio as if he have just as soon there be a regiment against they he be happy beyond word he pat he rifle barrel he spread out he big red bandanna beside he elbow and on it nicely arrange a couple of extra charge of cartridge prather remain flat on the bottom of the _ arroyo _ overwhelm it be some time before he could speak i -- i do not understand it be not possible he say finally everything be possible with leddy it seem that there can be peace between he and I in this valley in only one way jack answer but I i suppose he find out that i -- prather stop without finish the sentence what be i to do he ask jack in livid appeal why it be three against nine if you choose jack answer you have a rifle and it be for you life my life prather gasp another wave of fear submerge he yes we have no horse with which to make we escape and we should be wing as soon as we expose ourselves leddy mean that we shall die of thirst or die fight through all this dialogue jack have be speak to the head that lay between he eye and a target as prather reach up a tremble hand to take he rifle from the back of he burro one of the lump around the water-hole rise possibly to change position when it become the silhouette of a kneel man jack fire and the figure plunge forward like a automaton that have have its back broken eight whisper firio duck jack tell he for a response instantly come in a volley that kick up the dust around they head but jack 's rifle lay in limp hand eight he repeat dazedly and i shoot to kill -- to kill he face blanch with horror at the thing that he have do it seem as if the strength have be strike out of he he appear ready to let destiny overtake he rather than fire again then as in a flash the ancestor in he reappear and in he feature be write that very process of fate which dr bennington have say be in he again he hand be firm on the barrel and he eye rivet on the sight as he draw himself up until he lay even with the bank of the _ arroyo _ the volley from the cotton-wood have sweep over prather 's head at the instant that he have take hold of he rifle it drop from he grasp he burrow in the sand under the pressure of that near and sinister rush of singing breath i can not i can not he say helplessly he be leaden flesh without the power to move at he word jack glance back to see a drop jaw and glassy stare eye you be suffer exclaimed jack be you hit no prather manage to say and reach out for he rifle in clumsy desperation as if he be feel for it in the dark take you time say jack encouragingly as one would to a victim of stage fright there be not any danger for the moment while advantage of position be with we -- the sun over we shoulder and in they face the lump around the water-hole grow smaller evidently as a result of the lesson they be creep backward on they stomach to a less exposed position two have quite disappear or else the brilliant play of light have melt they into the golden carpet of reflect sunshine on which they rest directly jack see two figure creep over the rim of the pasturage basin so that be it he say to firio firio nod he understanding of leddy 's plan to take they in flank under cover of the _ arroyo _ we shall have to respond in kind say jack he leave he hat where he head have be and begin crawl along the side of the _ arroyo _ but pause to call to prather who now that no bullet be fly be try the mechanism of he rifle with a somewhat steadier hand : prather if you could manage to get up there beside firio and join he in pour out a magazine full at the right moment it would help if not put you hat up there beside mine you can do that without expose yourself jack 's tone be that of one who urge a tired man to take a few more step or a invalid without any appetite to try another sup of broth it have no hint of irony no matter say firio leddy know he can not fight leddy know there be only two of we he tone be without satire but its sting be sharper than satire that of a indian shrug over a negligible quantity it start prather on all fours laboriously toward he i be go to the turn in the _ arroyo _ that command the next turn jack explain when i whistle you empty you magazine keep you head down and fire fast no matter if not accurately so as to disturb they aim at I _ sí _ say firio i know no one could deny that he be have a very good time make war in the company of señor jack yes mister prather he add when after toiling painfully on he belly for the few foot he have to go prather lay with he stark face near firio 's a face strangely like that of john wingfield sr when he see jasper ewold from the drawing-room doorway for you life mister prather _ sí _ up a little more chin high as mine so eye on sight so prather obey in a abyssmal sort of shame which for the time be conquer he fear though not he palsy for he rifle barrel tremble on its rest meanwhile jack have creep to the bend in the _ arroyo _ he be listen it would not do to show he head as a warning of he presence faintly he hear man move in the sand move slowly and cautiously at the moment he choose as the right one with rifle cock and finger on trigger he give he signal then he spring to the top of the bank fully expose to the marksman at the water-hole for no half measure would do he must have a full view of the bottom of the next bend there he see two crawl figure he fire twice and drop down with three or four stinging whisper in he ear and a second volley overhead as he be under cover again he spring up over the bank in the temptation to see the result of he aim one of the would-be flanker lay prostrate and still face downward the other be disappear beyond the second bend seven now he think miserably in comprehension of the whole business as ridicule in human savagery they will not trouble we again immediately they will wait on darkness and thirst he conclude and call as he turn back to firio : it work like a charm o son of the sun they could not fire at all straight with you bullet fly about they head disturb they -- he speech end at sight of prather half rolling half tumble down the slope he hand over he face while he utter a prolonged moan bullet hit a rock under sand say firio as jack hasten to assist prather who have come to a halt at the very bottom of the _ arroyo _ and lay gasp on he side jack take hold of prather 's wrist to draw he hand away from the wound my god out here like a rat in a trap prather groan when i have all life before I in sight of million and power -- a rat in a trap out on this damnable desert as if i be of no more account than a rancher let I see say jack for prather be hold he hand tight against he face as if he fear that all the blood in he body would pour out if he remove they let I see maybe it be not so bad prather let he hand drop and the right one which be over the cheek with the mole be splash red between the finger on the cheek be a raw spot from which run a slight trickle the mole have go a splinter of rock or perhaps a bullet with its jacket split ricochet sidewise have tear it clean from the flesh not at all dangerous say jack no exclaimed prather in utter relief it will heal in a fortnight a small medicine case be among the regular supplies that be always pack on that omnibus of a burro jag ear while jack be bandage the wound firio who keep watch have no news to report nothing matter they will get we anyway prather moan the shock of be hit have quite finish any pretence at conceal he mortal fear of the outcome oh i

wisdom from the fate of they comrade from nogale leddy must have hear of the loss of two horse at best but one of the beleaguered three have any means of escape leddy could well afford to curb he impatience as he camp comfortably by the water-hole while he own horse graze the sun be still above the western ridge in the effulgence of its adieu for the day jack be on he knee with the broad level glare full on he look at prather who be in the shadow and he reflection be mix with that pity which one feel toward another who be lame or blind or suffer for the want of any sense or faculty that be

papers for the concession with you jack ask i -- i -- yes interpose jack firmly yes prather admit and you have pencil and paper to make some sort of transfer that will be the first legal step in undoing what you have do yes while prather be occupy with this jack find pencil and paper on he own account and by the light of the sun 's last ray and in the happiness of one who have bring a story to a good end he write to he father : john prather will tell you how he and i meet out on the desert before you come and of the long talk we have you want a son who would go on building on the great

of the fear of the mile in the night but -- there be no trick he hazard in suspicion no jack speak in such a way that it remove the last doubt for prather who knead he palm together in a kind of frenzy oblivious of all except the moneyed prospect of the kingdom crave that have become a kingdom win how long before i start he ask as soon as the first darkness settle and before the moon rise i

for prather to start how shall i know the direction prather ask trust pd he will find it say jack he hold the stirrup for prather to mount with the relief of free himself at last from the clinging touch of the phantom you be perfectly safe in two day you will be mount the step of a pullman on you way to new york and you what -- what be you go to do prather inquire hectically with a momentary qualm of shame why if firio and i be to have water to make coffee for breakfast we must take the water-hole jack answer as if this be a thing of minor importance beside see prather safely on he way be sure not to overwater pd after the night 's ride and do not overdo he on the final stretch and turn he over to galway when you arrive home pd home he conclude strike that good soldier with the flat of he hand on the buttock and pd trot away into the night jack listen to the hoof-beat on the soft earth die away and then creep up beside firio on the bank and gaze into the black wall in the direction of the cotton-wood a slight glow in the basin which must be leddy 's camp-fire be the only sign of life in the neighborhood the silence be profound he have not speak a word to firio with one problem forever solve he be absorb in another leddy drink eat wait whisper firio if we try to go they hunt we down yes say jack and we not go eh we stay we fight for water firio yes two against seven _ sí _ firio have no illusion about the situation _ sí _ he repeat stoically and firio -- jack 's hand slip with a quick grip caress onto firio 's shoulder a inspiration have come to the mind of action just as a line come to a poet in a flash as one must have come to the ancestor many time after he have go into a tight place trust to he wit and he blade to bring he out and firio we be go to change we base as the army man say -- and change it before the moon rise jag ear we shall have to leave you behind he add when they have drop back to the burro 's side just make yourself comfortable leddy surely would not think of kill so valuable a member of the non-combatant class we will come for you by and by it will be all right he give the sliver of ear a affectionate corkscrew twist before he and firio take all they ammunition crawl along the bottom of the _ arroyo _ and up the ridge where they settle down comfortably behind a ledge command the water-hole at easy range it be lucky we learn to shoot in the moonlight jack whisper _ sí _ firio answer in perfect understanding xxxvii the end of the weave for over a week a private car have stand on a siding at little river every morning a porter polish the brasswork of the platform in heraldry of the luxury within occasionally a young man with a plaster over a wound on he cheek would walk up and down the road-bed on the far side of the car indeed he have wear a path there he never go into town and any glance that he may have cast in that direction speak he desire to be forever free of its sight not a train pass that he do not wish himself aboard and away but as heir-apparent he have no thought of endanger he new kingdom by go before he father go he mean to keep very close to the throne he have become clingingly determinedly filial at time the gleam of the brasswork would exercise the same hypnosis over he sens as the scintillation of the jewelry counter of the store and he would rub he hand crisply together john wingfield sr spend little time in the car morning and afternoon and evening he would go over to dr patterson 's with the question : how be he which all little river be ask the rule of longevity be in oblivion and the routine channel of a mind so use to teem detail have become abyss as dark and void as the canyon of the range on the day of he arrival in little river he find a town people mostly by woman and child all of the man who could bear arm and get a horse have depart and with they mary thereby hang a story all to the honor of little ignacio after jack have ride away with he insistent refusal of assistance apprehension among the group that watch he disappear in the gathering darkness be allay by report of man who have be at the store where they find the leddyite hang about as usual true no one have see either pete or ropey smith but lang say that they be upstairs play poker a favorite relaxation from the strain of they intellectual life but ignacio learn from another indian in lang 's service that pete and seven of he best shot have start for agua fria about the same time as jack while the rest of the gang that have be leave behind be make it they business to cover the leader 's absence distrust ignacio they lock he in a closet off the bar in the early hour of the morning he succeed in escape with he news which he carry first to mary she be not asleep when he rap at she door it have be a night of wakefulness for she recall the night after she meeting with jack on the pass before the duel in the _ arroyo _ i for señor do not care now i for every devil in he and they go to kill he be the incoherent way in which he begin he announcement in a hour the alarm have travel from house to house while the gang sleep at lang 's or in they tent a solemn cavalcade set forth quietly into the night with rifle sling over they shoulder or lie across the pommel of they saddle bind to rescue jack wingfield they have protest against mary 's go with all the old familiar argument that occur to the male at thought of a woman in physical danger it be the least that any of we can do she declare but of what service will you be dr patterson ask no one can say yet she reply and no one shall stop I she be drive by the same impulse that have send she across the _ arroyo _ in face of the ruffian on the bank to jack 's side after he be wound my pony can keep up with the best of yours she add leddy have eight hour ' start on a two-day ' journey it be not in horse-flesh to gain much on he fast and hardened pony there be little chance that jack could hold out against such odds as he must face even if he have escape a ambush so they ride in desperation and in silence each too certain of what be in the mind of the other to make pretence of a hope that be not in the heart they only stop for rest be at las cascadas in the hot hour of midday darkness have fall when they overtake a solitary horseman come from agua fria john prather draw rein well to one side of the trail he have a moment as they approach in which to think out he explanation of he position it be prather and ride pd galway announce where be jack wingfield come the merciless question as in one voice from all you be he friend you have come to rescue he prather cry he seem overcome by he relief at all event the wildness of he exclamation in face of the force bar the trail be without affectation there be time there be hope yes yes gasp prather as the man begin to surround he why be you here why on he horse leddy turn on I too i be fight at wingfield 's side we get two of they before dark then i be wound and could not see to shoot and i come for help and you will be in time he be in a good position i think you be lie say galway he could not help it say bob worther how -- how would i have he horse if he be not willing protest prather frantically by steal it in keep with you character yes on general principle we ought to -- i have a piece of rope call a voice from the rear there be not any tree but we can drop he over the wall of a chasm spectral figure with set face appallingly grim in the thin moonlight press close to prather my god no he plead throatily we fight together i tell you we draw lot to see which one should take the risk of ride through danger to save the other lie again here be the rope all we have get to do be to slip a noose over he head it be a clean piece of rope be not it say the doge in he mellow voice i do not think it be worth while soil a clean piece of rope come take he life be no way to save jack 's come we be lose time right doge say the man with the rope but it be some satisfaction to give he a scare and take care of pd call another yes if you founder jack 's pony you 'll hear from we a-plenty this be they adieu to john prather who be leave to pursue he way in safety to he kingdom while they ride on follow a hard path at the base of the range those with the best horse take the lead while the heavier man include the doge whose weight be tell on they mount fall to the rear mary be at the head between dr patterson and jim galway the star flicker out the moon grow pale and for a while the horseman ride into a wall of blackness conscious of progress only by the sound of hoof-beat which they be relentlessly urge forward then dawn flash up over the chaos of rock pursue night with the sweep of its broaden translucent wing across the valley to the other range the top of the cotton-wood rise out of the sparkling sea float free of any visible support of trunk and the rescuer see that they be near the end of they journey there be a faint sound of a shot then of another shot and another after that the radiant baffling silence of daybreak on uninhabited waste when the very active glory of the spreading intensify light ought one feel to bring paean of orchestral splendor it set desperation in the heart of the rider which be communicate to weary pony drive to a last effort of speed and still no more shot the silence speak the end of some tragedy with the first streak from the rise sun clear a target to a wait marksman 's eye around the cotton-wood be no sign of human movement nothing but inanimate dark spot which develop into prostrate human form in pantomimic expression of the story of that night 's work do in the moonlight and finish with the first flush of morning two of the outstretched figure be lie head to head a few yard apart on either side of the water-hole the one on the side toward the ridge be recognize as jack still as death another a short distance behind he at the sound of hoof-beat look up with face blanch despite its dark skin the parched lip stretch over the tooth but in firio 's eye there be still fire as he whisper all right before he sink back unconscious a wound in he shoulder have be bandage but the wrist of he gun hand lay beside a fresh red spot on the earth jack have a bullet hole in the upper left arm plug with a bit of cotton and a deep furrow across the temple which be bleed he rigid finger be still grip he six-shooter he lay partly on he side face leddy who have roll over on he back dead mary and dr patterson drop from they horse simultaneously the doctor press he hand over jack 's heart to find it still beat jack they whisper jack they call aloud he rouse slightly lift he weary eyelid and gaze at they as if they be uncertain shadow who want some kind of a explanation from he which he have not the strength to give we must drink -- blaze away leddy he murmur i be come down after the star go out -- close -- close as you like -- we must drink no vital hit say the doctor while mary bring water assist he to bathe the wound before he dress they no not from a bullet he add after the dress be finish and he have one hand on jack 's hot brow and the other on he pulse then he attend to firio who be talk incoherently : take water-hole -- boil coffee in the morning -- quail for dinner señor jack -- _ sí sí _ when they have move jack and firio into the shadow of the cotton-wood and forced water down they throat firio revive enough to recognize those around he and to cry out a inquiry about jack but jack himself continue in a stupor apparently unconscious of he surroundings and scarcely alive except for breathing yet when litter of blanket and rifle tie together have be fashion and attach to the pack-saddle of tandem burro as he be lift into place for the return he seem to understand that he be start on a journey for he say disjointedly : do not forget wrath of god -- and jag ear be thirsty -- and bury wrath of god fittingly -- give he a epitaph he be gloomy but it be a good gloom a kind of kingly gloom and he like the prospect when at last he stick he head through the blue blanket of the horizon those of the party who remain behind for the last duty to the dead count its most solemn moment perhaps the one that give wrath of god the honorable due of a soldier who have fall face to the enemy bob worther write the epitaph with a pencil on a bit of wood : here lie the gloomiest pony that ever be the gloomier he be the better he go and the better jack wingfield like he which be bob 's way of interpret jack 's instruction then worther and he detail ride as fast as they might to overtake the slow-marching group in trail of the litter with the question that all little river have be ask ever since how be he a ghastly painfully tedious journey this homeward one make mostly in the night with the man go thirsty in the final stretch in order that wet bandage might be keep on jack 's feverish head while dr patterson be frequently thrust he little thermometer between jack 's hot crack lip if he be free of this jounce it be a terrible strain on he but the only thing be to go on the doctor keep repeat but when jack lay white and still in he bedroom and firio be rapidly convalesce the fever refuse to abate it seem bind to burn out the life that remain after the hemorrhage from he wound have cease man find it hard to work in the field while they wait on the crisis john wingfield sr sit for hour under dr patterson 's umbrella-tree in moody absorption he talk to all who would talk to he always he be ask about the duel in the _ arroyo _ which be fight in jack 's way he could not hear enough of it and later he almost attach himself to the one eye-witness of the final duel which have be fight in leddy 's way when firio be well enough to walk out he be to be find in a long chair on jack 's porch ever raise a warning finger for silence to anyone who approach and look out across the yard to jag ear who be win back the fat he have lose in a constitutional crisis and pd who after bear himself first and last in a manner characteristic of a pony who be pd but never q seem already none the worse for the hardship he have endure the master of twenty million would sit on the step while firio occupy the chair and regard he much as if he be a blank wall but at time firio would humor the persistent inquirer with a few abbreviated sentence it be out of such fragment as this that john wingfield sr have to piece the story of the fight for the water-hole señor jack and mister prather they no look alike say firio one day evidently bind to make a end of the father 's company anybody say that get bad eye mister prather -- and firio smile peculiarly -- i call he the mole he burrow in the sand so he hand tremble so he act like a man believe himself the only god in the world when he in no danger but when he get in danger he act like he afraid he get to meet some other god but jack now after prather have go persist the father greedily we glad the mole go it sort of hurt inside to think a man like he he make you wonder what for he bear john wingfield sr half rise in a sudden movement as if he be about to go but remain in response to another emotion that be stronger than the impulse and jack he keep he head he figure out he chance coolly now that trick he play by go up on the ridge under cover of darkness no trick say firio resentfully in instinctive defense that the place to fight señor jack he see it and all through the night you keep firing _ sí _ after moon very bright and over we shoulder in they face _ sí _ at the little lump that lie so still when they move quick like they sting we know we hit ah that be it you hit you hit and the other fellow could not you have the light with you -- everything jack have see to that he use he head he -- he be strong strong quite unconsciously john wingfield sr rub he palm together when you pleased you always rub you hand same as mister prather observe firio oh do i i -- john wingfield sr clasp he finger together tightly yes and the finish of the fight -- how be that sometimes when there no firing señor jack and leddy call out to each other leddy he swear hard like he fight señor jack he sing back he answer cheerful like he fight toward morning we both wound and only leddy and one other man alive on he side when a cloud slip over the moon and the big darkness before morning come we creep down from the ridge and with first light we bang-bang quick -- and i no remember any more force the fighting -- force it right at the end cry john wingfield sr in the flush of a great pride the aggressive that be it -- that be the way to win always but señor jack no fight just to win say firio he no want to fight in the big darkness before we crawl down to the water-hole he call out to leddy to make quit he almost beg leddy but leddy he say : ' i never quit and i get you ' ` sorry ' say señor jack with the devil out again ` sorry -- and we 'll see ' no señor jack no like to fight till you make he fight and the devil be out he fight for water he fight for peace he no want just to win and kill but -- but -- bring he story to a end firio look hard at the father he velvety eye shoot with a comprehend gleam as he shrug he shoulder -- but you no understand you and the mole john wingfield sr shift he gaze hurriedly from the little indian he face go ashen and it be work convulsively as he assist himself to rise by grip the veranda post why do you think that he ask i know say firio he lip close firmly that be all he have to say john wingfield sr turn away with the unsteady step of a man who be afraid of slip or stumble though the path be hard and even out in the street he meet the cold nod of the people of a town where he son have a dominion found on something that be lack in he own and one of those who nod to he ever so politely be a new citizen who have once be a unit of he own city within a city peter mortimer have arrive in little river only two day after he late employer peter have be like some old tree that everybody think have see its last winter but now he wait only on the good word from the sick-room for the sap of renew youth to rise in he vein and he shrivel branch to break into leaf at the call of spring and the good word do come thrilling through the community the physical crisis have pass the fever be burn itself out but a mental crisis develop and with it a new cause for apprehension even after jack 's temperature be normal and he should have be well on the road to convalescence there be a veil over he eye which would not allow he to recognize anybody when he speak it be in delirium living over some incident of the past or of sheer imagination now he be the ancestor fitting out he ship : no you can not come a man who be a malingerer on the london dock would be a malingerer on the spanish main i do not want bully and boaster let they stay at home to pick quarrel in the alley and cheer the lord mayor 's procession now he frigate be under full sail sight the enemy : suppose they have two gun to we one that make it about even we 'll get the windward side as we have before who care about they gun once we start to board another time he be on the trail : i 'll grow so strong so strong that he can never call I a weakling again he will be proud of I that be my only way to make good then he be apprentice to the million : all this detail make I feel as if my brain be a tangled spool of thread but i will master it -- i will again he be happily tell story to the child or tragically plead with leddy that there have be slaughter enough around the water-hole or serenely plan the future which he foresee for himself when the phantom be lay : i may not know how to run the store but i do seem to fit in here we can find the capital we will build the dam ourselves he body grow stronger with little appreciable change otherwise for a instant he would seem to know the person who be speak to he then he be away on the wind of delirium he mind be too strong for he not to come out of this all right it be only a question of time be not it insist the father there be a far greater capacity in he for suffer in that hellish fight than there be in pete leddy say dr patterson he have sensitiveness to impression which be bear in he at the same time that a will of steel be bear in he -- the sensitiveness of the mother perhaps and the will of the ancestor he life hang by a thread when we find he and he nerve have be twist and tortured by the ordeal of that night and that be not all there be more than fight something that precede the fight be even harder on he i know from he look when he set out for agua fria that he be under a terrible strain a strain worse than that of a few hour ' battle -- the kind that have be weigh day after day on the will that grimly sustain its weight and that wound in the head be very close very and it come at the moment when he collapse in reaction after that last tell shot something snap then there be a fracture of the kind that only nature can set will he come out of this delirium you ask i do not know much depend upon whether that strain be over for good or if it be still press on he mind when he rise from he bed he may be himself or he may ride away madly into the face of the sun i do not know nobody on earth can know yes yes say john wingfield sr slowly in jack 's wildest moment it be mary 's voice that have the most telling effect however low she speak he seem always to recognize the tone and would greet it with a smile and frequently break into verse and scrap of remembered conversation of he boyhood exile in villa garden one morning when she and dr patterson have enter the room together jack call out miserably : just kill kill kill what will mary say to I now he raise he hand finger spread and stare at they with a ghastly look she spring to the bedside and seize they fast in hers and bend very close to he as if she would impart conviction with every quiver particle of she be she say : she think you splendid she be glad glad it be just what she want you to do she wish every bullet that you fire luck -- luck for you sake to speed it straight to the mark he seem to understand what she be say as one understand that shade be cool after the broiling torment of the sun luck will always come at you command mary he whisper repeat he last word when he leave the ewold garden to go to the war and she want you to rest -- just rest -- and not worry this have the effect of a soothing draught smilingly he fall back on the pillow and sleep you put some spirit into that say the doctor after he and mary have tiptoe out of the room a little of the spirit in keep with a dark-eyed girl who live in the land of the eternal painter all i have answer mary with simple earnestness at noon jack be still sleep he sleep on through the last hour of the day the first long stretch he have have run the bulletin from tongue to tongue and real sleep too -- the kind that count in the late afternoon when the coolness and the shadow of evening be creep in at the door and window the doctor peter mortimer the father and firio be on the veranda while mr galway be on watch by the bedside he be wake she come out to whisper the doctor hasten past she into the sick-room as he enter jack look up with a bright puzzle light in he eye just what do this mean he ask just how do it happen that i be here i think that i -- we bring you in some day ago the doctor explain and since you take the water-hole you mind have be enjoy a little vacation while we move you body about as we please i take the water-hole then and firio firio he -- he be just wait outside to congratulate you on the re-establishment of the old cordial relation between mind and body the doctor return and slip out to call firio and to announce : he be right as rain right as rain news that mr galway set forth immediately to herald through the community as for firio he stride into jack 's presence with the air of conqueror sage and prophet in one be it really you firio come here so that i can feel of you and make sure you son of the sun jack put out he thin white hand to firio and the velvet of firio 's eye be very soft indeed do you know when they bring you in jack ask when burro stumble i feel ouch and see desert and then i drift away up to sky again answer firio all right now eh pretty soon you so strong i have to broil five -- six -- seven quail a day and still you hungry the doctor who have be look on from the doorway feel a vigorous touch on the arm and turn to hear john wingfield sr ask he to make way with a grimace approach a scowl he draw back free of jack 's sight and hold up he hand in protest you have better not excite he he whisper but i be he father say john wingfield sr with something of he old masterful manner in a moment of irritation as he push by the doctor he pause rather abruptly when he eye meet jack 's a faint flush appear in jack 's cheek only emphasize he wanness and the whiteness of he neck and chin and forehead well jack right as rain they say i know you would come out all right it be in the blood that -- and the rest of john wingfield sr 's speech fall away into inarticulateness it be a weak emaciated son this son whom he see in contrast to the one who have enter he office unannounced one morning and yet the father now feel that same indefinable radiation of calm strength close he throat that he have feel then jack be look steadily in he father 's direction but through he as through a thin shadow and into the distance he smile but very faintly and very meaningly father you will keep the bargain i have make he say as if this be a thing admit of no dispute it be fair to the other one be not it yes we have find the truth at last have not we and the truth make it all clear for he and for you and for I you mean -- it be all over -- you stay out here for good -- you -- say john wingfield sr gropingly then another figure appear in the doorway and jack 's eye return from the distance to rest on it fondly in response to a impulse that he could not control peter mortimer be peer timidly into the sick-room why peter exclaim jack happily come farther in so i can see more of you than the tip of you nose after a glance of inquiry at the doctor which receive a affirmative nod peter venture another step so it be salad and rose be it peter jack continue well i think you may telegraph any time now that the other can come as soon as they be ready and they place be fill thus john wingfield sr have he answer thus the process of fate that dr bennington have say be in the younger man have work out they end under the spur of a sudden powerful resolution the father withdraw in the living-room he meet jasper ewold the two man pause face each other they be alone with the frank daring feature from velasquez 's brush and with the i give i give of the sargent both reflect the afterglow of sunset while the feature of the living -- john wingfield sr 's in stony anger and jasper ewold 's serene in philosophy -- tell they story without the touch of a painter 's genius you have steal my son jasper ewold declare john wingfield sr with the bitterness of one whose personal edict exclude defeat from he lexicon only to find it writ broad across the page i suppose you think you have win damn you jasper ewold the doge flush he seem on the point of a outburst then he look significantly from the portrait of the ancestor to the portrait of the mother he be never yours to lose be the answer without passion john wingfield sr recoil avoid a glance at the wall where the picture hang the doge step to one side to leave the way clear john wingfield sr go out unsteadily with head bow but he have not go far before he head go up with a jerk and he strike fist into palm decisively rigidly ignore everyone he pass and look straight ahead he walk rapidly toward the station as if every step mean welcome freedom from the earth that it touch he private car be attach to the evening express and while it start homeward with the king and the determinedly filial heir-apparent to the citadel of the push-button through all the garden of little river run the joyous news that jack be right as rain it be a thing to start a continual exchange of visit and to keep the light burn in the house unusually late but all be dark and silent out at bill lang 's store after they return from agua fria the rescue party jim galway lead have attend to another matter the remnant of pete leddy 's gang far from offer any resistance explain that they have business elsewhere which admit of no delay there be peace in the valley of little river its phantom have be lay at the same time as jack 's xxxviii they side of the pass persiflage persiflage cry the doge he and jack be in the full tilt of controversy jack press a advantage as they come around the corner of the ewold house it be like the old time and better than the old time for now there be understand where then there have be mystery the stream of they comradeship run smoothly in a open country with no unsounded depths but i notice that you always say persiflage just as i be get the better of the argument jack whip back have it take you all this time to find that out for what purpose be the word in the english vocabulary but i 'll take the other side which be the easy one next time and then we 'll see boom boom the doge purse out he lip in mock terrorization of he opponent you be pretty near yourself again young sir he add as he pause at the opening in the hedge yes strength have be fairly flood back the last two or three day i can feel it travel in my vein and make the tissue expand it be glorious to be alive o doge now do you want I to take the other side on that question so you can have another unearned victory i refuse to humor the invalid any longer and i agree the proposition that it be glorious to live on such a afternoon as this be carry unanimously but i will never agree that you can grow date the equal of mine not until my first crop be ripe then there will be no dispute that be real persiflage the doge call after jack jack have make he first visit to the doge 's garden since he have leave it to meet prather and leddy rather brief when he find that mary be not
